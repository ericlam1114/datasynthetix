We are selling our podcast business as we are shifting our focus to a different venture. Our podcasts, which feature sleep sounds like rain and contain no spoken content, generate an average annual revenue of $50,000. The sounds are downloaded from Splice.com, and no recording is required.

The process involves minimal manual labor; the only task is to extend a one-minute sound file to an hour, a process known as 'looping'.

Our podcasts are hosted for free on Spreaker.com because we are a Prime partner. Our agency is the largest sleep podcast organization in the world with over 40 million downloads.

Managing these podcasts requires only 2 hours per week. They are primarily listened to by people suffering from depression or sleep issues. Since our podcasts continue to play while our listeners sleep, we attract more listeners for advertisements, resulting in high advertising revenue. In some months, we have earned up to â‚¬15,000 from advertising revenue.
