All Rights Reserved.\nNFPA 70E\n®\nStandard for\nElectrical Safety in the Workplace\n®\n2021 Edition\nThis edition of NFPA 70E\n®\n, Standard for Electrical Safety in the Workplace\n®\n, was prepared by the\nTechnical Committee on Electrical Safety in the Workplace and released by the Correlating\nCommittee on National Electrical Code\n®\n. It was issued by the Standards Council on June 1, 2020,\nwith an effective date of June 21, 2020, and supersedes all previous editions.\nThis edition of NFPA 70E was approved as an American National Standard on June 21, 2020.\nForeword to NFPA 70E\nThe Standards Council of the National Fire Protection Association announced the formal\nappointment of a new electrical standards development committee on January 7, 1976. The\nCommittee on Electrical Safety Requirements for Employee Workplaces reported to the association\nthrough the Technical Correlating Committee on National Electrical Code\n®\n (NEC\n®\n). The committee was\nformed to assist OSHA in preparing an electrical safety standard that would serve OSHA's needs and\nthat could be expeditiously promulgated through the provisions of Section 6(b) of the Occupational\nSafety and Health Act. OSHA found that in attempting to utilize the latest edition of the NEC, it was\nconfronted with the following problems:\n(1) OSHA could only adopt or modify a standard through procedures that provide for public\nnotice, opportunity for public comment, and public hearings. The adoption of a new NEC edition by\nthese procedures would require extensive effort and application of resources by OSHA and others.\nGoing through the procedures might result in requirements substantially different from those of the\nNEC, thereby creating a conflict between the two standards.\n(2) The NEC is intended for use primarily by those who design, install, and inspect electrical\ninstallations. Most of the NEC requirements are not electrical safety–related work practices, electrical\nsystem maintenance, or directly related to employee safety. However, OSHA electrical regulations,\nwhich address employers and employees in their workplaces, needed to consider and develop these\nsafety areas.\nIt became apparent that a need existed for a new standard tailored to fulfill OSHA's\nresponsibilities that would still be fully consistent with the NEC. This led to the concept of a new\ndocument that would extract suitable portions from the NEC and from other documents applicable\nto electrical safety. This concept and an offer of assistance was submitted in May 1975 to the Assistant\nSecretary of Labor for OSHA, who responded as follows: \"The concept, procedures, and scope of the\neffort discussed with my staff for preparing the subject standard appear to have great merit, and an\napparent need exists for this proposed consensus document which OSHA could consider for\npromulgation under the provisions of Section 6(b) of the Act. OSHA does have an interest in this\neffort and believes the proposed standard would serve a useful purpose.\" With this positive\nencouragement from OSHA, the NFPA Electrical Section unanimously supported a\nrecommendation that the NEC Correlating Committee examine the feasibility of developing a\ndocument for evaluating electrical safety in the workplace. With recommendations from the\nElectrical Section and Correlating Committee, the Standards Council authorized the establishment\nof a committee to carry out this examination.\nThe committee would develop a standard for electrical installations that would be compatible\nwith the OSHA requirements for employee safety in locations covered by the NEC. The standard was\nvisualized as consisting of four major parts: Part I, Installation Safety Requirements; Part II, Safety-\nRelated Work Practices; Part III, Safety-Related Maintenance Requirements; and Part IV, Safety\nRequirements for Special Equipment. It was not considered essential for all of the parts to be\ncompleted before the standard was published and made available. Each part was recognized as being\nCopyright National Fire Protection Association \nProvided by IHS Markit under license with NFPA\n\n\nELECTRICAL SAFETY IN THE WORKPLACE\n70E–2\nELECTRICAL SAFETY IN THE WORKPLACE    2021 Edition\nan important aspect of electrical safety in the workplace, but the parts were sufficiently independent of each other to permit\ntheir separate publication. The first edition of NFPA 70E, Standard for Electrical Safety Requirements for Employee Workplaces, was\npublished in 1979 and included only Part I, Installation Safety Requirements.\nThe second edition published in 1981 included a new Part II, Safety-Related Work Practices. In 1983, the third edition\nadded a new Part III, Safety-Related Maintenance Requirements. In 1988, the fourth edition was published with only minor\nrevisions.\nThe 1995 edition included major revisions to Part I to conform to the 1993 edition of the NEC. The concepts of \"limits of\napproach\" and establishment of an \"arc\" were introduced in Part II. In 2000, the sixth edition included an update of Part I to\nthe 1999 NEC, as well as a new Part IV, Safety Requirements for Special Equipment. Part II continued to focus on establishing\nflash protection boundaries and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Also, charts were added to Part II to assist in\napplying appropriate protective clothing and personal protective equipment for common tasks.\nThe 2004 edition presented several significant changes. The major changes emphasized safe work practices. Clarity and\nusability of the document were also enhanced. The title was changed to Standard for Electrical Safety in the Workplace. The\ndocument was reformatted to comply with the National Electrical Code Style Manual. The existing parts were renamed as chapters\nand were reorganized with the safety-related work practices relocated to the front of the document to highlight the emphasis,\nfollowed by safety-related maintenance requirements, safety requirements for special equipment, and safety-related installation\nrequirements. The chapter on safety-related work practices also was reorganized to emphasize that working on live parts is the\nlast alternative work practice. An energized electrical work permit and related requirements were incorporated into the\ndocument.\nThis standard is compatible with the NEC but is not intended to be used, nor can it be used, in lieu of the NEC. Chapter 4,\nSpecific Purpose Equipment and Installations, was intended to serve a very specific need of OSHA. It was not intended to be\napplied as a design, installation, modification, or construction standard for an electrical installation or system. Its content was\nintentionally limited in comparison to the NEC in order to apply to an electrical installation or a system as part of an\nemployee's workplace. Chapter 4 was updated to correlate with the 2002 edition of the NEC, but requirements not directly\nassociated with employee safety were not included. Omission of NEC requirements did not affect the NEC, nor were omitted\nrequirements considered as unimportant. They are essential to the NEC and its intended application — that is, its use by those\nwho design, install, and inspect electrical installations. NFPA 70E, on the other hand, is intended for use by employers,\nemployees, and OSHA.\nRequirements were upgraded throughout the 2009 edition. Chapter 4 was deleted because it was a duplicate of NEC\ninstallation requirements. Article 350 was added for R&D facilities. Other changes included significant revisions to Annex D,\nAnnex F, and Annex J and the addition of Annex M, Annex N, and Annex O.\nThe 2012 edition marked another waypoint as this standard continued to evolve to meet the electrical safety needs of\nemployers and employees. New research, new technology, and technical input from users provided the foundation for new and\nrevised requirements that addressed the electrical hazards encountered by employees in current workplaces. Expanded or\nclarified requirements, inclusion of technical material not previously covered, and removal of requirements related to the safe\ninstallation of electrical equipment rather than being safe electrical work practices were some of the major actions undertaken\nduring the revision cycle. In addition, requirements covering the separate but directly related concepts of hazard identification\nand risk assessment were revised to clarify the concepts. A significant revision to Annex F provided extensive coverage of this\ntopic to assist users with implementing effective hazard identification and risk assessment procedures. Annex P on aligning\nNFPA 70E implementation with occupational health and safety management standards was added.\nThe majority of changes occurred in Chapter 1. Article 105, Application of Safety-Related Work Practices, and a\nrequirement for hearing protection when working within an arc flash boundary were added, as were work practice\nrequirements on the use of GFCIs to protect employees. Clarification was made that Article 130 applies whether incident\nenergy analysis or the hazard/risk table was used to determine use and level of PPE. Short-circuit current, fault clearing time,\nand arc flash boundary information were included in the hazard/risk category tables. Another major revision included\nchanging \"flame-resistant (FR)\" to \"arc-rated (AR)\" in regard to PPE.\nThe 2015 edition incorporated a major shift in how stakeholders evaluate electrical risk. In support of this, new definitions\nfor hazard, hazardous, risk, and risk assessment were added to Article 100. Throughout the document, changes were made to\nprovide clarity to users, such as changing hazard analysis to risk assessment. These global changes ensured consistent use of these\nterms throughout the document and provided consistency between NFPA 70E and other standards that address hazards and\nrisk. Other major revisions included the following:\n(1) The definition of a qualified person was revised to correlate with the OSHA definition.\n(2) Safety-related maintenance requirements and other administrative controls were added to the scope statement to clarify\nthat training and auditing are equally important safety-related work practices.\n(3) An electrical safety program must consider condition of maintenance.\nCopyright National Fire Protection Association \nProvided by IHS Markit under license with NFPA\n\n\nORIGIN & DEVELOPMENT\n2021 Edition    ELECTRICAL SAFETY IN THE WORKPLACE\n70E–3\n(4) Clarification was provided that the equipment owner or the owner’s designated representative is responsible for\nmaintenance of the electrical equipment and documentation.\n(5) New maintenance requirements were added for test instruments and associated test leads utilized in the verification of\nthe absence or presence of voltages.\n(6) New requirements clarified where normal operation of electric equipment is permitted.\n(7) Clarification was made that either the incident energy analysis method or arc flash PPE category method can be used on\na piece of equipment for the selection of PPE, but not both. The revision clarified that the results of an incident energy\nanalysis is not permitted to be used to specify an arc flash PPE category.\n(8) A new task-based table combined the previously separate ac and dc tables used to determine when arc flash PPE is\nrequired and made them consistent, improving usability.\n(9) New equipment-based tables were added for determining the arc flash PPE category for ac systems and for dc systems.\n(10) Hazard/risk category 0 was removed because the new PPE table only specifies PPE for work within the arc flash\nboundary. Hazard/risk category was also changed to PPE category.\n(11) Prohibited approach boundary was deleted because additional protective equipment was not required when crossing\nthis boundary.\n(12) The criterion to use insulated tools or handling equipment was changed from the limited approach boundary to\nrestricted approach boundary.\n(13) All references to bare-hand work were removed. This work is considered to be a \"utility type\" line work technique more\nappropriately addressed in other standards.\n(14) Field-marked equipment labeling requirements were revised to require an updated label when the arc flash hazard risk\nassessment identifies a change that renders the label inaccurate.\n(15) A risk assessment is required prior to any work on a battery system to identify the chemical, electrical shock, and arc\nflash hazards and assess the risks associated with the type of tasks to be performed.\nThe 2018 edition continued to evolve to address risk assessment and introduce human factors, such as human error, as part\nof that assessment. Annex Q, Human Performance and Workplace Electrical Safety, was included to provide guidance in this\narea. This edition emphasized the need to use the hierarchy of risk controls by moving it from an informational note into the\ntext of the standard. NFPA 70E explicitly stated that the first priority must be the elimination of the hazard.\nThe previous arc flash hazard identification table [Table 130.7(C)(15)(A)(a)] was modified to determine the likelihood\nthat an arc flash could occur and renumbered as Table 130.5(C). This modified table could be used with either method of arc\nflash risk assessment.\nThe most notable change for the 2018 edition was that tables and text that specified PPE standards were moved to\ninformational tables or notes. In previous editions employers were, and still are, required to verify that appropriate PPE is\ngiven to employees. Section 130.7(C)(14)(b) was added to provide guidance on conformity assessment of PPE. These changes\ndid not alter the employer’s responsibility for determining the validity of the PPE manufacturer’s claims.\nDefinitions for fault current and available fault current were added, and other terms used throughout the standard for this\ncurrent were changed for consistency. Article 120 was rearranged to present the requirements for establishing an electrically\nsafe work condition in a logical order of application of the program. Article 320 introduced voltage thresholds of 50 Vac and\n100 Vdc specifically for batteries and battery rooms to address the unique situations in these locations. Article 330 addressing\nlasers was extensively revised to address safety-related maintenance issues rather than issues associated with laser use. Article\n350 introduced an Electrical Safety Authority as a possible authority having jurisdiction for laboratories.\nFor the 2021 edition, Article 110 was revised to incorporate the general requirements for electrical safety-related work\nprograms, practices, and procedures from other articles. The reference to arc-resistant switchgear has been changed to arc-\nresistant equipment in Tables 130.5(C) and 130.7(C)(15)(a) to address the use of other types of arc-resistant equipment.\nArticle 360, Safety-Related Requirements for Capacitors, and Annex R, Working with Capacitors, were added to address specific\nelectrical safety requirements unique to capacitors. Annex D, Incident Energy and Arc Flash Boundary Calculation Methods,\nwas revised to reference IEEE-1584-2018 as a method of calculation.\nCopyright National Fire Protection Association \nProvided by

Risk assessment is an overall\nprocess that involves estimating both the likelihood of occurrence and severity to determine if additional\nprotective measures are required. The estimate of the likelihood of occurrence contained in this table does\nnot cover every possible condition or situation, nor does it address severity of injury or damage to health.\nWhere this table identifies “No” as an estimate of likelihood of occurrence, it means that an arc flash incident\nis not likely to occur. Where this table identifies “Yes” as an estimate of likelihood of occurrence, it means an\narc flash incident should be considered likely to occur. The likelihood of occurrence must be combined with\nthe potential severity of the arcing incident to determine if additional protective measures are required to be\nselected and implemented according to the hierarchy of risk control identified in 110.5(H)(3).\nInformational Note No. 1: An example of a standard that provides information for arc-resistant\nequipment referred to in Table 130.5(C) is IEEE C37.20.7, Guide for Testing Switchgear Rated Up to 52 kV\nfor Internal Arcing Faults.\nInformational Note No. 2: Improper or inadequate maintenance can result in increased fault clearing\ntime of the overcurrent protective device, thus increasing the incident energy. Where equipment is not\nproperly installed or maintained, PPE selection based on incident energy analysis or the PPE category\nmethod might not provide adequate protection from arc flash hazards.\nInformational Note No. 3: Both larger and smaller available fault currents could result in higher\nincident energy. If the available fault current increases without a decrease in the fault clearing time of\nthe overcurrent protective device, the incident energy will increase. If the available fault current\ndecreases, resulting in a longer fault clearing time for the overcurrent protective device, incident\nenergy could also increase.\nInformational Note No. 4: The occurrence of an arcing fault inside an enclosure produces a variety of\nphysical phenomena very different from a bolted fault. For example, the arc energy resulting from an\narc developed in the air will cause a sudden pressure increase and localized overheating. Equipment\nand design practices are available to minimize the energy levels and the number of procedures that\ncould expose an employee to high levels of incident energy. Proven designs such as arc-resistant\nswitchgear, remote racking (insertion or removal), remote opening and closing of switching devices,\nhigh-resistance grounding of low-voltage and 5000-volt (nominal) systems, current limitation, and\nspecification of covered bus or covered conductors within equipment are available to reduce the risk\nassociated with an arc flash incident. See Informative Annex O for safety-related design requirements.\nInformational Note No. 5: For additional direction for performing maintenance on overcurrent\nprotective devices, see Chapter 2, Safety-Related Maintenance Requirements.\nInformational Note No. 6: See IEEE 1584, Guide for Performing Arc Flash Hazard Calculations, for more\ninformation regarding incident energy and the arc flash boundary for three-phase systems.\nCopyright National Fire Protection Association \nProvided by IHS Markit under license with NFPA\n\n\nARTICLE 130 — WORK INVOLVING ELECTRICAL HAZARDS\n130.5\nShaded text = Revisions.

Where   insulated   footwear   is   used   as\nprotection against step and touch potential, dielectric footwear\nshall  be  required.  Insulated  soles  shall  not  be  used  as  primary\nelectrical protection.\nInformational  Note:  Electrical  Hazard  footwear  meeting  ASTM\nF2413, Standard Specification for Performance Requirements for Protec‐\ntive  (Safety)  Toe  Cap  Footwear,  can  provide  a  secondary  source  of\nelectric shock protection under dry conditions.\n(9) Factors  in  Selection  of  Protective  Clothing.  Clothing  and\nequipment that provide worker protection from shock and arc\nflash  hazards  shall  be  used.  If  arc-rated  clothing  is  required,  it\nshall cover associated parts of the body as well as all flammable\napparel while allowing movement and visibility.\nClothing  and  equipment  required  for  the  degree  of  expo‐\nsure  shall  be  permitted  to  be  worn  alone  or  integrated  with\nflammable,  nonmelting  apparel.  Garments  that  are  not  arc\nrated  shall  not  be  permitted  to  be  used  to  increase  the  arc\nrating of a garment or of a clothing system.\nInformational  Note:  Protective  clothing  includes  shirts,  pants,\ncoveralls,  jackets,  and  parkas  worn  routinely  by  workers  who,\nunder  normal  working  conditions,  are  exposed  to  momentary\nelectric  arc  and  related  thermal  hazards.  Arc-rated  rainwear\nworn in inclement weather is included in this category of cloth‐\ning.\n(a)     Layering. Nonmelting, flammable fiber garments shall\nbe permitted to be used as underlayers in conjunction with arc-\nrated  garments  in  a  layered  system.  If  nonmelting,  flammable\nfiber  garments  are  used  as  underlayers,  the  system  arc  rating\nshall  be  sufficient  to  prevent  breakopen  of  the  innermost  arc-\nrated  layer  at  the  expected  arc  exposure  incident  energy  level\nto  prevent  ignition  of  flammable  underlayers.  Garments  that\nare not arc rated shall not be permitted to be used to increase\nthe arc rating of a garment or of a clothing system.\nInformational  Note:  A  typical  layering  system  might  include\ncotton  underwear,  a  cotton  shirt  and  trouser,  and  an  arc-rated\ncoverall.  Specific  tasks  might  call  for  additional  arc-rated  layers\nto achieve the required protection level.\n(b)     Outer  Layers.  Garments  worn  as  outer  layers  over  arc-\nrated  clothing,  such  as  jackets\n,  high-visibility  apparel,  or  rain‐\nwear, shall also be made from arc-rated material. The arc rating\nof outer layers worn over arc-rated clothing as protection from\nthe elements or for other safety purposes, and that are not used\nas part of a layered system, shall not be required to be equal to\nor greater than the estimated incident energy exposure.\n(c)     Underlayers.  Meltable  fibers  such  as  acetate,  nylon,\npolyester,  polypropylene,  and  spandex  shall  not  be  permitted\nin fabric underlayers.\nException:  An  incidental  amount  of  elastic  used  on  nonmelting  fabric\nunderwear or socks shall be permitted.\nInformational Note No. 1: Arc-rated garments (e.g., shirts, trou‐\nsers,  and  coveralls)  worn  as  underlayers  that  neither  ignite  nor\nmelt  and  drip  in  the  course  of  an  exposure  to  electric  arc  and\nrelated  thermal  hazards  generally  provide  a  higher  system  arc\nrating than nonmelting, flammable fiber underlayers.\nInformational  Note  No.  2:  Arc-rated  underwear  or  undergar‐\nments used as underlayers generally provide a higher system arc\nrating  than  nonmelting,  flammable  fiber  underwear  or  under‐\ngarments used as underlayers.\n(d)     Coverage.  Clothing  shall  cover  potentially  exposed\nareas  as  completely  as  possible.  Shirt  and  coverall  sleeves  shall\nbe  fastened  at  the  wrists,  shirts  shall  be  tucked  into  pants,  and\nshirts, coveralls, and jackets shall be closed at the neck.\n(e)     Fit.  Tight-fitting  clothing  shall  be  avoided.  Loose-\nfitting  clothing  provides  additional  thermal  insulation  because\nof  air  spaces.  Arc-rated  apparel  shall  fit  properly  such  that  it\ndoes not interfere with the work task.\n(f)     Interference.  The  garment  selected  shall  result  in  the\nleast  interference  with  the  task  but  still  provide  the  necessary\nprotection.  The  work  method,  location,  and  task  could  influ‐\nence the protective equipment selected.\n(10)  Arc Flash Protective Equipment.\n(a)     Arc  Flash  Suits.

Power system modeling is the best method to determine the available short-circuit current at the point of the arc. Battery cell short-\ncircuit current can be obtained from the battery manufacturer. See D.5 for the basis for table values and alternative methods to determine dc\nincident energy. Methods should be used with good engineering judgment.\nInformational Note No. 2: The methods for estimating the dc arc flash incident energy that were used to determine the categories for this\ntable are based on open-air incident energy calculations. Open-air calculations were used because many battery systems and other dc process\nsystems are in open areas or rooms.

Where  a  conductor  or  circuit  part  is\nconnected  to  a  capacitor(s)  operating  at  or  above  the  thresh‐\nolds  in  360.3,  a  written  procedure  shall  be  used  to  document\nthe necessary steps and sequence to discharge the capacitor(s)\nand  place  the  equipment  into  an  electrically  safe  work  condi‐\ntion. The written procedure shall incorporate the results of the\nrisk  assessment  performed  in  360.5(B)  and  specify  the  follow‐\ning at a minimum:\nN(B) Safe  Work  Practices.  In  order  to  place  the  capacitor(s)\ninto an electrically safe work condition, a qualified person shall\nuse  the  appropriate  safe  work  practices  and  PPE  and  shall\napply  the  following  process  for  establishing  and  verifying  an\nelectrically safe work condition:\n(1)Determine  all  possible  sources  of  electrical  supply  to  the\nspecific  equipment.  Check  applicable  up-to-date  draw‐\nings, diagrams, and identification tags.\n(2)After  properly  interrupting  the  load  current,  open  the\ndisconnecting device(s) for each source.\n(3)Wherever  possible,  visually  verify  that  all  blades  of  the\ndisconnecting devices are fully open or that drawout-type\ncircuit  breakers  are  withdrawn  to  the  fully  disconnected\nposition.\n(4)Apply lockout/tagout devices in accordance with a docu‐\nmented and established policy.\n(5)If bleed resistors or automatic discharge systems are appli‐\ncable,  wait  the  prescribed  time  for  the  capacitors  to\ndischarge   to   less   than   the   thresholds   in   360.3   and\nproceed to step (6). For systems without bleed resistors or\nautomatic   discharge   systems,   discharge   the   capacitors\nwith  an  adequately  rated  grounding  device  (e.g.,  ground\nstick).  Soft  grounding  shall  be  performed  above  1000\njoules,  and  remote  soft  grounding  shall  be  performed\nabove 100 kJ.\n(6)Verify  that  the  capacitors  are  discharged.  For  capacitors\nless than 1000 joules, verification shall be permitted to be\ndone  either  by  testing  or  by  grounding.  For  capacitors\nbetween  1000  joules  and  less  than  100  kJ,  verification\nshall  be  done  using  testing  or  soft  grounding,  then  hard\ngrounding.  Above  100  kJ,  an  engineered  and  redundant\nsystem  shall  be  used  for  remote  testing  and  grounding.\nAn  adequately  rated  portable  test  instrument  shall  be\nused  to  test  between  each  capacitor  terminal  and  from\nCopyright National Fire Protection Association \nProvided by IHS Markit under license with NFPA\n\n\nARTICLE 360 — SAFETY-RELATED REQUIREMENTS FOR CAPACITORS\n360.6\nShaded text = Revisions.

If  voltage  remains,  deter‐\nmine  and  correct  the  cause,  and  repeat  step  (5)  to\ndischarge  the  capacitors.  Where  recharging  can  occur\ndue  to  dielectric  absorption  or  induced  voltages,  all  the\ncapacitor   terminals   shall   be   connected   together   and\ngrounded with a bare or transparent-insulated wire.\n(8)For  series  capacitors  the  shorting  wires  shall  be  attached\nacross each individual capacitor, and to case.\nFor  single  capacitors  or  for  a  parallel  capacitor  bank,  the\ngrounding  device  shall  be  permitted  to  be  left  attached  to  the\ncapacitor terminals for the duration of the work (e.g., a ground\nstick).\nException:  Lockout/tagout  shall  not  be  required  for  work  on  cord-  and\nplug-connected equipment for which exposure to the hazards of unexpec‐\nted energization of the equipment is controlled by the unplugging of the\nequipment  from  the  energy  source,  provided  that  the  plug  is  under  the\nexclusive  control  of  the  employee  performing  the  servicing  and  mainte‐\nnance for the duration of the work.\nN360.6 Grounding  Sticks.  Grounding  sticks  shall  be  provided\nfor  qualified  persons  to  safely  discharge  any  residual  stored\nenergy contained in capacitors or to hold the capacitor poten‐\ntial at 0 volts. The grounding sticks shall be designed, construc‐\nted, installed, and periodically inspected so that the full energy\nand voltage of the capacitors can be safely discharged.\nN(A) Visual   Inspection.  The   ground   stick   shall   be   visually\ninspected  for  defects  before  each  use.  All  mechanical  connec‐\ntions  shall  be  examined  for  loose  connections.  Resistors  shall\nbe visually inspected for cracks or other defects and electrically\ntested for proper resistance. The following shall occur if defects\nor contamination are found:\n(1)If any defect or contamination that could adversely affect\nthe  insulating  qualities  or  mechanical  integrity  of  the\nground  stick  is  present,  the  tool  shall  be  removed  from\nservice.\n(2)If  the  defect  or  contamination  exists  on  the  grounding\nstick,  then  it  shall  be  replaced  or  repaired  and  tested\nbefore returning to service.\n(3)If the defect or contamination exists on the cable, then it\nshall be replaced or repaired and tested before returning\nto service.\nN(B) Electrical  Testing.  All  ground  sticks  shall  be  electrically\ntested as follows:\n(1)The  ground  stick  cable  shall  be  tested  to  verify  that  the\nimpedance is less than 0.1 ohms to ground every 2 years.\n(2)The testing shall be documented.\nException: The test shall be performed annually if the ground stick is\nutilized outdoors or in other adverse conditions.\n(3)Soft grounding (High-Z) ground sticks with resistors shall\nbe measured and compared to the specified value before\neach use.\nN(C) Storage and Disposal.  Any residual charge from capacitors\nshall be removed by discharging before servicing or removal.\n(1)All  uninstalled  capacitors  capable  of  storing  10  joules  or\ngreater at their rated voltage shall be short-circuited with\na conductor of appropriate size.\n(2)When  an  uninstalled  capacitor  is  discovered  without  the\nshorting  conductor  attached  to  the  terminals,  it  shall  be\ntreated  as  energized  and  charged  to  its  full  rated  voltage\nuntil determined safe by a qualified person.\nInformational Note: A capacitor that develops an internal open\ncircuit  could  retain  substantial  charge  internally  even  though\nthe   terminals   are   short-circuited.   Such   a   capacitor   can   be\nhazardous  to  transport,  because  the  damaged  internal  wiring\ncould reconnect and discharge the capacitor through the short-\ncircuiting  conductor.  Any  capacitor  that  shows  a  significant\nchange  in  capacitance  after  a  fault  could  have  this  problem.\nAction  should  be  taken  to  reduce  the  risk  associated  with  this\nhazard when it is discovered.\nCopyright National Fire Protection Association \nProvided by IHS Markit under license with NFPA\n\n\nINFORMATIVE ANNEX A\n70E–56\nShaded text = Revisions.

Observing   a   safe   approach\ndistance   from   exposed   energized   electrical   conductors   or\ncircuit  parts  is  an  effective  means  of  maintaining  electrical\nsafety. As the distance between a person and the exposed ener‐\ngized  conductors  or  circuit  parts  decreases,  the  potential  for\nelectrical incident increases.\nC.1.1 Unqualified  Persons,  Safe  Approach  Distance.  Unquali‐\nfied  persons  are  safe  when  they  maintain  a  distance  from  the\nexposed  energized  conductors  or  circuit  parts,  including  the\nlongest  conductive  object  being  handled,  so  that  they  cannot\ncontact  or  enter  a  specified  air  insulation  distance  to  the\nexposed  energized  electrical  conductors  or  circuit  parts.  This\nsafe   approach   distance   is   the   limited   approach   boundary.\nFurther,  persons  must  not  cross  the  arc  flash  boundary  unless\nthey  are  wearing  appropriate  personal  protective  clothing  and\nare  under  the  close  supervision  of  a  qualified  person.  Only\nwhen  continuously  escorted  by  a  qualified  person  should  an\nunqualified   person   cross   the   limited   approach   boundary.\nUnder no circumstance should an unqualified person cross the\nrestricted  approach  boundary,  where  special  shock  protection\ntechniques and equipment are required.\nC.1.2 Qualified Persons, Safe Approach Distance.\nC.1.2.1  Determine the arc flash boundary and, if the boundary\nis  to  be  crossed,  appropriate  arc-rated  protective  equipment\nmust be utilized.\nC.1.2.2  For  a  person  to  cross  the  limited  approach  boundary\nand  enter  the  limited  space,  a  person  should  meet  the  follow‐\ning criteria:\n(1)Be qualified to perform the job/task\n(2)Be  able  to  identify  the  hazards  and  associated  risks  with\nthe tasks to be performed\nC.1.2.3  To  cross  the  restricted  approach  boundary  and  enter\nthe  restricted  space,  qualified  persons  should  meet  the  follow‐\ning criteria:\n(1)As  applicable,  have  an  energized  electrical  work  permit\nauthorized by management.\n(2)Use personal protective equipment (PPE) that is rated for\nthe voltage and energy level involved.\n(3)Minimize  the  likelihood  of  bodily  contact  with  exposed\nenergized  conductors  and  circuit  parts  from  inadvertent\nmovement  by  keeping  as  much  of  the  body  out  of  the\nrestricted space as possible and using only protected body\nparts in the space as necessary to accomplish the work.\n(4)Use insulated tools and equipment.\n(See Figure C.1.2.3.)\nC.2 Basis   for   Distance   Values   in   Tables   130.4(E)(a)   and\n130.4(E)(b).\nC.2.1 General   Statement.  Columns   2   through   5   of   Table\n130.4(E)(a)   and   Table   130.4(E)(b)   show   various   distances\nfrom  the  exposed  energized  electrical  conductors  or  circuit\nparts. They include dimensions that are added to a basic mini‐\nmum  air  insulation  distance.  Those  basic  minimum  air  insula‐\ntion  distances  for  voltages  72.5  kV  and  under  are  based  on\nIEEE  4,  Standard  Techniques  for  High  Voltage  Testing,  Appendix\n2B; and voltages over 72.5 kV are based on IEEE 516, Guide for\nMaintenance Methods on Energized Power Lines. The minimum air\ninsulation  distances  that  are  required  to  avoid  flashover  are  as\nfollows:\n(1)≤300 V: 1 mm (0 ft 0.03 in.)\n(2)>300 V to ≤750 V: 2 mm (0 ft 0.07 in.)\n(3)>750 V to ≤2 kV: 5 mm (0 ft 0.19 in.)\n(4)>2 kV to ≤15 kV: 39 mm (0 ft 1.5 in.)\n(5)>15 kV to ≤36 kV: 161 mm (0 ft 6.3 in.)\n(6)>36 kV to ≤48.3 kV: 254 mm (0 ft 10.0 in.)\n(7)>48.3 kV to ≤72.5 kV: 381 mm (1 ft 3.0 in.)\n(8)>72.5 kV to ≤121 kV: 640 mm (2 ft 1.2 in.)\n(9)>138 kV to ≤145 kV: 778 mm (2 ft 6.6 in.)\n(10)>161 kV to ≤169 kV: 915 mm (3 ft 0.0 in.)\n(11)>230 kV to ≤242 kV: 1.281 m (4 ft 2.4 in.)\n(12)>345 kV to ≤362 kV: 2.282 m (7 ft 5.8 in.)\n(13)>500 kV to ≤550 kV: 3.112 m (10 ft 2.5 in.)\n(14)>765 kV to ≤800 kV: 4.225 m (13 ft 10.3 in.)\nC.2.1.1 Column  1.  The  voltage  ranges  have  been  selected  to\ngroup  voltages  that  require  similar  approach  distances  based\non the sum of the electrical withstand distance and an inadver‐\ntent movement factor. The value of the upper limit for a range\nis the maximum voltage for the highest nominal voltage in the\nrange, based on ANSI C84.1, Electric Power Systems and Equipment\n—  Voltage  Ratings  (60  Hz).  For  single-phase  systems,  select  the\nrange  that  is  equal  to  the  system’s  maximum  phase-to-ground\nvoltage multiplied by 1.732.\nC.2.1.2 Column  2.

Informative  Annex  D  summarizes  calcula‐\ntion  methods  available  for  calculating  arc  flash  boundary  and\nincident energy. It is important to investigate the limitations of\nany  methods  to  be  used.  The  limitations  of  methods  summar‐\nized in Informative Annex D are described in Table D.1.\nD.2  Ralph Lee Calculation Method.\nΔD.2.1 Basic  Equations  for  Calculating  Arc  Flash  Boundary\nDistances.  The  short-circuit  symmetrical  ampacity,  I\nsc\n,  from  a\nbolted three-phase fault at the transformer terminals is calcula‐\nted with the following formula:\nIMVAVZ\nsc\n=×÷××÷ % Base    101 732100\n6\n\n\n\n\n[]\n{}\n{}\n.\nwhere I\nsc\n is in amperes, V is in volts, and %Z is based on the\ntransformer MVA.\nA  typical  value  for  the  maximum  power,  P  (in  MW)  in  a\nthree-phase arc can be calculated using the following formula:\nPMVA\nbf\n=×maximum bolted fault, in \n\n\n\n\n0 707\n2\n.\nPV   I\nsc\n=××××\n−\n1 73210   0 707\n62\n..\nThe arc flash boundary distance is calculated in accordance\nwith the following formulae:\nDMVAt\ncbf\n=××2 65\n1\n2\n.\n\n\n\n\n \n[D.2.1a]\n \n[D.2.1b]\n \n[D.2.1c]\n \n[D.2.1d]N\nDMVA    t\nc\n=××53\n1\n2\n[]\nwhere:\nD\nc\n=distance in feet of person from arc source for a just\ncurable burn (that is, skin temperature remains less\nthan 80°C).\nMVA\nbf\n=\nbolted fault MVA at point involved.\nMVA\n=MVA rating of transformer. For transformers with MVA\nratings below 0.75 MVA, multiply the transformer MVA\nrating by 1.25.\nt\n=time of arc exposure in seconds.\nThe  clearing  time  for  a  current-limiting  fuse  is  approxi‐\nmately  \n1\n∕\n4\n  cycle  or  0.004  second  if  the  arcing  fault  current  is  in\nthe  fuse’s  current-limiting  range.  The  clearing  time  of  a  5-kV\nand  15-kV  circuit  breaker  is  approximately  0.1  second  or  6\ncycles  if  the  instantaneous  function  is  installed  and  operating.\nThis  can  be  broken  down  as  follows:  actual  breaker  time\n(approximately 2 cycles), plus relay operating time of approxi‐\nmately 1.74 cycles, plus an additional safety margin of 2 cycles,\ngiving  a  total  time  of  approximately  6  cycles.  Additional  time\nmust be added if a time delay function is installed and operat‐\ning.\nThe  formulas  used  in  this  explanation  are  from  Ralph  Lee,\n“The  Other  Electrical  Hazard:  Electrical  Arc  Flash  Burns,”  in\nIEEE  Trans.  Industrial  Applications.  The  calculations  are  based\non the worst-case arc impedance. (See Table D.2.1.)\nD.2.2 Single-Line    Diagram    of    a    Typical    Petrochemical\nComplex.

The following\nequations can be used to predict the incident energy produced\nby  a  three-phase  arc  on  systems  rated  600  V  and  below.

(Calculations\nshould  be  made  using  the  maximum  value,  and  then  at\nlowest  fault  level  at  which  the  arc  is  self-sustaining.  For\n480-volt systems, the industry accepted minimum level for\na  sustaining  arcing  fault  is  38  percent  of  the  available\nbolted  fault,  three-phase  short-circuit  current.

This  guide  provides  models  and  an  analytical\nprocess to enable calculation of the predicted incident thermal\nenergy and the arc-flash boundary (AFB). The process covers a\ncollection  of  applicable  field  data,  consideration  of  power\nsystem  operating  scenarios,  and  calculation  parameters.  Appli‐\ncations include electrical equipment and conductors for three-\nphase alternating current (ac) voltages from 208 volts to 15 kV.\nCalculations for single-phase ac systems and direct current (dc)\nsystems  are  not  a  part  of  this  guide,  but  some  guidance  and\nreferences  are  provided  for  those  applications.  Recommenda‐\ntions  for  personal  protective  equipment  (PPE)  to  mitigate  arc-\nflash hazards are not included in this guide.\nND.4.3  Purpose.  The  purpose  of  the  guide  is  to  enable  quali‐\nfied  person(s)  to  analyze  power  systems  for  the  purpose  of\ncalculating the incident energy (IE) to which employees could\nbe exposed during operations and maintenance work.

It  is  intended  for  use  only  by  qualified\npersons  who  are  knowledgeable  about  power  system  studies,\npower   distribution   equipment,   and   equipment   installation\npractices. It is not intended as a substitute for the engineering\njudgment and adequate review necessary for such studies.\nThis guide is based upon testing and analysis of the thermal\nburn hazard presented by incident energy. Due to the explosive\nnature  of  arc-flash  incidents,  injuries  can  occur  from  ensuing\nmolten metal splatters, projectiles, pressure waves, toxic arc by-\nproducts,  the  bright  light  of  the  arc,  and  the  loud  noise\nproduced. These other effects are not considered in this guide.\nThis guide is subject to revision as additional knowledge and\nexperience  is  gained.  IEEE,  those  companies  that  contributed\ntest data, and those people who worked on the development of\nthis standard make no guarantee of results and assume no obli‐\ngation  or  liability  whatsoever  in  connection  with  this  informa‐\ntion.\nThe methodology in this guide assumes that all equipment is\ninstalled,  operated,  and  maintained  as  required  by  applicable\ncodes, standards, and manufacturers’ instructions, and applied\nin  accordance  with  its  ratings.  Equipment  that  is  improperly\ninstalled  or  maintained  may  not  operate  correctly,  possibly\nincreasing  the  arc  flash  incident  energy  or  creating  other\nhazards.\n•\nN\nTable D.4.6  Electrode Orientation and Configurations\nE.C.StandardOrientationConfigurationTermination\nVOA2002/2018VerticalOpen airOpen air\nVCB2002/2018VerticalMetal \nenclosure\nOpen air\nVCBB2018VerticalMetal \nenclosure\nInsulating \nbarrier\nHOA2018HorizontalOpen airOpen air\nHCB2018HorizontalMetal \nenclosure\nOpen air\nCopyright National Fire Protection Association \nProvided by IHS Markit under license with NFPA\n\n\nINFORMATIVE ANNEX D\nShaded text = Revisions.

The following method of esti‐\nmating  dc  arc  flash  incident  energy  that  follows  was  published\nin the IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications (see reference 2 of\nD.5.2). This method is based on the concept that the maximum\npower possible in a dc arc will occur when the arcing voltage is\none-half the system voltage. Testing completed for Bruce Power\n(see reference 3 of D.5.3) has shown that this calculation is conser‐\nvatively  high  in  estimating  the  arc  flash  value.  This  method\napplies to dc systems rated up to 1000 \nvolts.\nII\nIEVIT    D\narcbf\nmsysarcarc\n=×\n=×××\n0 5\n0 01\n2\n.\n.\nwhere:\nI\narc\n=\narcing current, amperes\nI\nbf\n=\nsystem bolted fault current, amperes\nIE\nm\n=estimated dc arc flash incident energy at the maximum\npower point, cal/cm\n2\nV\nsys\n=\nsystem voltage, volts\nT\narc\n=\narcing time, sec\nD\n=working distance, cm\nFor  exposures  where  the  arc  is  in  a  box  or  enclosure,  it\nwould   be   prudent   to   consider   additional   PPE   protection\nbeyond the values shown in Table 130.7(C)(15)(b).\nD.5.2 Detailed    Arcing    Current    and    Energy    Calculations\nMethod.

The   determination   of   short\ncircuit current is necessary in order to use Table 130.7(C)(15)\n(b).  The  arcing  current  is  calculated  at  50  percent  of  the  dc\nshort-circuit   value.   The   current   that   a   battery   will   deliver\ndepends  on  the  total  impedance  of  the  short-circuit  path.  A\nconservative approach in determining the short-circuit current\nthat the battery will deliver at 25°C is to assume that the maxi‐\nmum  available  short-circuit  current  is  10  times  the  1  minute\nampere  rating  (to  1.75  volts  per  cell  at  25°C  and  the  specific\ngravity  of  1.215)  of  the  battery.  A  more  accurate  value  for  the\nshort-circuit   current   for   the   specific   application   can   be\nobtained from the battery manufacturer.\nReferences:\n1.

Risk management is the\nlogical,  systematic  process  used  to  manage  the  risk  associated\nwith any activity, process, function, or product including safety,\nthe  environment,  quality,  and  finance.  The  risk  management\nprocess and principles can be used by organizations of any type\nor size.\nThe  following  risk  management  principles  can  readily  be\napplied to electrical safety. Risk management:\n(1)Is  an  integral  part  of  all  organizational  processes  and\ndecision making\n(2)Is systematic, structured, and timely\n(3)Is based on the best available information\n(4)Takes human and cultural factors into account\n(5)Is dynamic, iterative, and responsive to change\n(6)Facilitates continual improvement of the organization\nInformational Note: For more information on risk management\nprinciples see ISO 31000:2009, Risk Management — Principles and\nGuidelines.\nThe risk management process includes the following:\n(1)Communication and consultation\n(2)Establishing the risk assessment context and objectives\n(3)Risk assessment\n(4)Risk treatment\n(5)Recording  and  reporting  the  risk  assessment  results  and\nrisk treatment decisions\n(6)Monitoring and reviewing risks\nRisk assessment is the part of risk management that involves\nthe following:\n(1)Identifying sources of risk\n(2)Analyzing the sources of risk to estimate a level of risk\n(3)Evaluating the level of risk to determine if risk treatment\nis required\n(See Figure F.1.)\nF.1.1 Occupational  Health  and  Safety  (OHS)  Risk  Manage‐\nment.  The same logical, systematic process and the same prin‐\nciples apply to risk management in the OHS sphere of activity.\nHowever,   it   is   more   focused   and   the   terminology   more\nnarrowly defined, as follows:\n(1)The  OHS  objective  is  freedom  from  harm  (i.e.,  injury  or\ndamage to health).\n(2)Sources of risk are referred to as hazards.\n(3)Analyzing  and  estimating  the  level  of  risk  is  a  combina‐\ntion of the estimation of the likelihood of the occurrence\nof harm and the severity of that harm.\n(4)The level of risk is evaluated to determine if it is reasona‐\nble to conclude that freedom from harm can be achieved\nor if further risk treatment is required.\n(5)Risk treatment is referred to as risk control.\nTherefore, OHS risk assessment involves the following:\n(1)Hazard identification: Find, list, and characterize hazards.\n(2)Risk analysis: Sources, causes, and potential consequences\nare analyzed to determine the following:\na.The likelihood that harm might result\nb.The potential severity of that harm\nc.Estimate the level of risk\n(3)Risk  evaluation:  The  level  of  risk  is  evaluated  to  deter‐\nmine if the objective of freedom from harm can reasona‐\nbly be met by the risk control that is in place or is further\nrisk control required?\nF.2 Relationship  to  Occupational  Health  and  Safety  Manage‐\nment  System  (OHSMS).  As  discussed  in  Annex  P,  the  most\neffective  application  of  the  requirements  of  this  standard  can\nbe  achieved  within  the  framework  of  an  OHSMS.  Using  a\nmanagement system provides a methodical approach to health\nand safety by means of goal setting, planning, and performance\nmeasurement.\nRisk management shares the six management system process\nelements of the following:\n(1)Leadership.  If  any  venture  is  to  succeed  it  needs  to  be\nsponsored at the highest levels of the organization.\n(2)Policy.  The  organization  should  articulate  its  vision  and\nestablish relevant, attainable goals.\n(3)Plan.  A  plan  is  developed  in  line  with  the  organization’s\nvision  and  to  achieve  its  goals.  The  plan  must  include\nmechanisms  to  measure  and  monitor  the  success  of  the\nplan.\nEstablishing the context\nMonitor\nand\nreview\nHazard identification\nRisk analysis\nRisk evaluation\nRisk control\nRisk assessment\nFIGURE  F.1     Risk Management Process (Adapted from ISO\n31000 figure 3).\nCopyright National Fire Protection Association \nProvided by IHS Markit under license with NFPA\n\n\nINFORMATIVE ANNEX F\n70E–70\nShaded text = Revisions. Δ = Text deletions and figure/table revisions.    • = Section deletions. N = New material.\n(4)Do. The plan is executed.\n(5)Check  (Monitor).  The  success  of  the  plan  in  achieving\nthe organization’s goals is continuously monitored.\n(6)Act  (Review).  The  measuring  and  monitoring  results  are\ncompared to the organization’s goals for the purposes of\nreviewing   and   revising   goals   and   plans   to   improve\nperformance.\nAs noted in F.1, risk management is iterative. The repeating\nnature  of  the  management  system  plan-do-check-act  (PDCA)\ncycle   is   intended   to   promote   continuous   improvement   in\nhealth and safety performance.\nRisk  assessment  fits  into  the  “plan”  and  “do”  stages  of  the\nPDCA cycle, as follows:\n(1)Planning:  Information  used  during  the  planning  stage\ncomes  from  sources  that  can  include  workplace  inspec‐\ntions, incident reports, and risk assessments.\n(2)Do: Risk assessment is an ongoing activity.\nF.3 Hierarchy  of  Risk  Control.  The  purpose  of  specifying  and\nadhering  to  a  hierarchy  of  risk  control  methods  is  to  identify\nthe  most  effective  individual  or  combination  of  preventive  or\nprotective measures to reduce the risk associated with a hazard.\nEach  risk  control  method  is  considered  less  effective  than  the\none before it. Table F.3 lists the hierarchy of risk control identi‐\nfied in this and other safety standards and provides examples of\neach.\nF.4 Hazard-Based   Risk   Assessment.  In   a   hazard-based   risk\nassessment, workplace hazards are identified and characterized\nfor  materials,  processes,  the  worksite,  and  the  environment.\nActivities that might be affected by those hazards are identified.\nThe risk associated with each activity is analyzed for likelihood\nTable F.3  The Hierarchy of Risk Control Methods\nRisk Control MethodExamples\n(1) EliminationConductors and circuit parts in an \nelectrically safe working condition\n(2) SubstitutionReduce energy by replacing 120 V \ncontrol circuitry with 24 Vac or Vdc \ncontrol circuitry\n(3) Engineering controlsGuard energized electrical conductors \nand circuit parts to reduce the \nlikelihood of electrical contact or \narcing faults\n(4) AwarenessSigns alerting of the potential \npresence of hazards\n(5) Administrative \ncontrols\nProcedures and job planning tools\n(6) PPEShock and arc flash PPE\nof  harm  and  severity  of  harm.  An  organization  uses  this  infor‐\nmation to prioritize risk reduction decisions.\nThe information from hazard-based risk assessments is useful\nto  organizations  when  designing,  specifying,  and  purchasing\nelectrical  distribution  equipment.  Risk  control  is  much  more\neffective  when  it  is  applied  at  the  beginning  of  the  equipment\nor process lifecycle. Risk can be reduced by specifying “substitu‐\ntion”  and  “engineering”  risk  control  methods  that  affect  the\nlikelihood of occurrence of harm or severity of harm.\nF.5 Task-Based  Risk  Assessment.  In  a  task-based  risk  assess‐\nment,  a  job  is  broken  down  into  discrete  tasks.  Hazards  are\nidentified for each task (often referred to as task-hazard pairs).\nThe risk associated with each hazard is analyzed and evaluated.\nThe  task-based  risk  assessment  is  the  most  commonly  used\nwhen performing a field level risk assessment.\nF.6 Risk Assessment Methods.  There are many risk assessment\nmethods.  The  method  or  combination  of  methods  should  be\nchosen based on the following:\n(1)The application\n(2)The desired result\n(3)The skill level of the persons performing the assessment\nSome risk assessment methods include the following:\n(1)Brainstorming.   An   open   group   discussion   regarding\nhazards, the associated risk, and risk control methods can\nbe  used  as  part  of  pre-job  planning  and  during  a  job\nbriefing session.\n(2)Checklists. A list of common hazards and possible control\nmethods is a useful tool for pre-job planning and for job\nbriefing  purposes.  See  Annex  I  for  an  example  of  a  job\nbriefing and planning checklist.\n(3)Risk   assessment   matrix.   A   risk   assessment   matrix   is\ncommonly used to quantify levels of risk. The matrix can\nbe  in  a  multilevel  or  a  simple  two-by-two  format.  See\nFigure F.6 for an example of a risk assessment matrix.\nInformational  Note:  See  ISO  31010,  Risk  management  —  Risk\nassessment  techniques,  and  ANSI/AIHA  Z10-2012,  Occupational\nHealth  and  Safety  Management  Systems,  for  further  information\nregarding risk assessment methods.\nNF.7 Battery Risk Assessment.  Multiple hazards may be encoun‐\ntered  when  working  on  batteries  (shock,  arc  flash,  chemical,\nthermal).  PPE  selection  should  take  into  account  all  of  the\nhazards  depending  on  the  task.  The  flow  chart  displayed  in\nFigure  F.7  will  assist  users  to  assess  all  hazards  associated  with\nwork on batteries.\nCopyright National Fire Protection Association \nProvided by IHS Markit under license with NFPA\n\n\nINFORMATIVE ANNEX F\nShaded text = Revisions.

Tagout  is  an  alternative\nmethod  that  is  available  to  employers.  The  sample  program\nand  procedures  that  follow  are  provided  to  assist  employers  in\ndeveloping  a  lockout/tagout  program  and  procedures  that\nmeet the requirements of Article 120 of NFPA 70E.The sample\nprogram  and  procedures  can  be  used  for  a  simple  lockout/\ntagout or as part of a complex lockout/tagout. A more compre‐\nhensive  procedure  will  need  to  be  developed,  documented,\nand used for the complex lockout/tagout.\nLOCKOUT/TAGOUT PROGRAM\nFOR [COMPANY NAME]\nOR\nTAGOUT PROGRAM FOR [COMPANY NAME]\n1.0  Purpose.  This    procedure    establishes    the    minimum\nrequirements  for  lockout  /tagout  of  electrical  energy  sources.\nIt is to be used to ensure that conductors and circuit parts are\ndisconnected    from    sources    of    electrical    energy,    locked\n(tagged),  and  tested  before  work  begins  where  employees\ncould  be  exposed  to  dangerous  conditions.  Sources  of  stored\nenergy,  such  as  capacitors  or  springs,  shall  be  relieved  of  their\nenergy, and a mechanism shall be engaged to prevent the reac‐\ncumulation of energy.\n2.0  Responsibility.  All  employees  shall  be  instructed  in  the\nsafety significance of the lockout/tagout procedure. All new or\ntransferred employees and all other persons whose work opera‐\ntions  are  or  might  be  in  the  area  shall  be  instructed  in  the\npurpose and use of this procedure. [Name(s) of the person(s) or the\njob  title(s)  of  the  employee(s)  with  responsibility]  shall  ensure  that\nappropriate  personnel  receive  instructions  on  their  roles  and\nresponsibilities.  All  persons  installing  a  lockout/tagout  device\nshall  sign  their  names  and  the  date  on  the  tag  [or  state  how  the\nname of the individual or person in charge will be available].\n3.0  Preparation for Lockout/Tagout.\n3.1  Review  current  diagrammatic  drawings  (or  their  equiva‐\nlent),  tags,  labels,  and  signs  to  identify  and  locate  all  discon‐\nnecting  means  to  determine  that  power  is  interrupted  by  a\nphysical  break  and  not  de-energized  by  a  circuit  interlock.\nMake a list of disconnecting means to be locked (tagged).\n3.2  Review  disconnecting  means  to  determine  adequacy  of\ntheir  interrupting  ability.  Determine  if  it  will  be  possible  to\nverify a visible open point, or if other precautions will be neces‐\nsary.\n3.3  Review other work activity to identify where and how other\npersonnel might be exposed to electrical hazards. Review other\nenergy  sources  in  the  physical  area  to  determine  employee\nexposure  to  those  sources  of  other  types  of  energy.  Establish\nenergy control methods for control of other hazardous energy\nsources in the area.\n3.4  Provide  an  adequately  rated  test  instrument  to  test  each\nphase  conductor  or  circuit  part  to  verify  that  they  are  de-\nenergized  (see  Section  G.11.3).  Provide  a  method  to  determine\nthat the test instrument is operating satisfactorily.\n3.5  Where the possibility of induced voltages or stored electri‐\ncal  energy  exists,  call  for  grounding  the  phase  conductors  or\ncircuit parts before touching them. Where it could be reasona‐\nbly  anticipated  that  contact  with  other  exposed  energized\nconductors or circuit parts is possible, call for applying ground\nconnecting devices.\n4.0 Simple     Lockout/Tagout.  The     simple     lockout/tagout\nprocedure  will  involve  G.1.0  through  G.3.0,  G.5.0  through\nG.9.0, and G.11.0 through G.13.0.\n5.0  Sequence of Lockout/Tagout System Procedures.\n5.1  The  employees  shall  be  notified  that  a  lockout/tagout\nsystem  is  going  to  be  implemented  and  the  reason  for  it.  The\nqualified   employee   implementing   the   lockout/tagout   shall\nknow  the  disconnecting  means  location  for  all  sources  of  elec‐\ntrical  energy  and  the  location  of  all  sources  of  stored  energy.\nThe qualified person shall be knowledgeable of hazards associ‐\nated with electrical energy.\n5.2  If  the  electrical  supply  is  energized,  the  qualified  person\nshall de-energize and disconnect the electric supply and relieve\nall stored energy.\n5.3  Wherever  possible,  the  blades  of  disconnecting  devices\nshould be visually verified to be fully opened, or draw-out type\ncircuit breakers should be verified to be completely withdrawn\nto the fully disconnected position.\n5.4  Lockout/tagout  all  disconnecting  means  with  lockout/\ntagout devices.\nInformational  Note:  For  tagout,  one  additional  safety  measure\nmust  be  employed,  such  as  opening,  blocking,  or  removing  an\nadditional circuit element.\n5.5  Attempt to operate the disconnecting means to determine\nthat operation is prohibited.\n5.6  A  test  instrument  shall  be  used.  (See  G.11.3.)  Inspect  the\ninstrument  for  visible  damage.  Do  not  proceed  if  there  is  an\nindication  of  damage  to  the  instrument  until  an  undamaged\ndevice is available.\n5.7  Verify  proper  instrument  operation  on  a  known  source  of\nvoltage and then test for absence of voltage.\n5.8  Verify  proper  instrument  operation  on  a  known  source  of\nvoltage after testing for absence of voltage.\n5.9  Where  required,  install  a  grounding  equipment/conduc‐\ntor  device  on  the  phase  conductors  or  circuit  parts,  to  elimi‐\nnate  induced  voltage  or  stored  energy,  before  touching  them.\nWhere it has been determined that contact with other exposed\nenergized conductors or circuit parts is possible, apply ground\nconnecting devices rated for the available fault duty.\nCopyright National Fire Protection Association \nProvided by IHS Markit under license with NFPA\n\n\nINFORMATIVE ANNEX G\nShaded text = Revisions.

The  person  in  charge  shall  be  at  the\nprocedure location.\n9.3  The person in charge shall develop a written plan of execu‐\ntion and communicate that plan to all persons engaged in the\njob or task. The person in charge shall be held accountable for\nsafe   execution   of   the   complex   lockout/tagout   plan.   The\ncomplex lockout/tagout plan must address all the concerns of\nemployees  who  might  be  exposed,  and  they  must  understand\nhow electrical energy is controlled. The person in charge shall\nensure  that  each  person  understands  the  electrical  hazards  to\nwhich  they  are  exposed  and  the  safety-related  work  practices\nthey are to use.\n9.4  All  complex  lockout/tagout  plans  identify  the  method  to\naccount  for  all  persons  who  might  be  exposed  to  electrical\nhazards in the course of the lockout/tagout.\nOne of the following methods is to be used:\n(1)Each individual shall install his or her own personal lock‐\nout or tagout device.\n(2)The person in charge shall lock his/her key in a lock box.\n(3)The  person  in  charge  shall  maintain  a  sign-in/sign-out\nlog for all personnel entering the area.\n(4)Another equally effective methodology shall be used.\n9.5  The  person  in  charge  can  install  locks/tags  or  direct  their\ninstallation on behalf of other employees.\n9.6  The person in charge can remove locks/tags or direct their\nremoval on behalf of other employees, only after all personnel\nare  accounted  for  and  ensured  to  be  clear  of  potential  electri‐\ncal hazards.\n9.7  Where the complex lockout/tagout is continued on succes‐\nsive  shifts,  the  person  in  charge  shall  identify  the  method  for\ntransfer of the lockout and the method of communication with\nall employees.\n10.0  Discipline.\n10.1  Knowingly violating the requirements of this program will\nresult in [state disciplinary actions that will be taken].\n10.2  Knowingly   operating   a   disconnecting   means   with   an\ninstalled lockout device (tagout device) will result in [state disci‐\nplinary actions to be taken].\n11.0  Equipment.\n11.1  Locks shall be [state type and model of selected locks].\n11.2  Tags shall be [state type and model to be used].\n11.3  The  test  instrument(s)  to  be  used  shall  be  [state  type  and\nmodel].\n12.0  Review.

Table\n130.5(C),  Table  130.7(C)(15)(a),  Table  130.7(C)(15)(b),  and\nTable  130.7(C)(15)(c)  provide  guidance  for  the  selection  and\nuse of PPE when using arc flash PPE categories.\nH.2 Simplified  Two-Category  Clothing  Approach  for  Use  with\nTable   130.7(C)(15)(a),   Table   130.7(C)(15)(b),   and   Table\n130.7(C)(15)(c).  The use of Table H.2 is a simplified approach\nto provide minimum PPE for electrical workers within facilities\nwith large and diverse electrical systems. The clothing listed in\nTable H.2 fulfills the minimum arc-rated clothing requirements\nof  Table  130.7(C)(15)(a),  Table  130.7(C)(15)(b),  and  Table\n130.7(C)(15)(c).   The   clothing   systems   listed   in   this   table\nshould be used with the other PPE appropriate for the arc flash\nPPE  category  [see  Table  130.7(C)(15)(c)].  The  notes  to  Table\n130.7(C)(15)(a),  Table  130.7(C)(15)(b),  and  Table  130.7(C)\n(15)(c) must apply as shown in those tables.\nH.3 Arc-Rated  Clothing  and  Other  Personal  Protective  Equip‐\nment   (PPE)   for   Use   with   Risk   Assessment   of   Electrical\nHazards.  Table  H.3  provides  a  summary  of  specific  sections\nwithin  the  NFPA  70E  standard  describing  PPE  for  electrical\nhazards.\nH.4 Conformity Assessment of Personal Protective Equipment\n(PPE).\nH.4.1  Introduction.  Section   130.7(C)(14)   requires   personal\nprotective  equipment  (PPE)  provided  by  a  supplier  or  manu‐\nfacturer to conform to appropriate product standards by one of\nthree  methods.  Additional  information  for  these  conformity\nassessment methods can be found within ANSI/ISEA 125, Amer‐\nican  National  Standard  for  Conformity  Assessment  of  Safety  and\nPersonal Protective Equipment. ANSI/ISEA 125 establishes criteria\nfor  conformity  assessment  of  safety  and  PPE  that  is  sold  with\nclaims  of  compliance  with  product  performance  standards.\nANSI/ISEA 125 contains provisions for data collection, product\nverification,    conformation    of    quality    and    manufacturing\nproduction control, and roles and responsibilities of suppliers,\ntesting  organizations,  and  third-party  certification  organiza‐\ntions.\nH.4.2 Level of Conformity.  ANSI/ISEA 125 provides for three\ndifferent levels of conformity assessment: Level 1, Level 2, and\nLevel 3.\nLevel  1  conformity  is  where  the  supplier  or  manufacturer  is\nmaking  a  self-declaration  that  a  product  meets  all  of  the\nrequirements   of   the   standard(s)   to   which   conformance   is\nclaimed.  A  supplier  Declaration  of  Conformity  for  each  prod‐\nuct  is  required  to  be  made  available  for  examination  upon\nrequest.\nLevel  2  conformity  is  where  the  supplier  or  manufacturer  is\nmaking  a  self-declaration  that  a  product  meets  all  of  the\nrequirements   of   the   standard(s)   to   which   conformance   is\nclaimed,   the   supplier   or   manufacturer   has   a   registered\nISO  9001  Quality  Management  System  or  equivalent  quality\nmanagement system, and all testing has been carried out by an\nISO 17025 accredited testing laboratory. A supplier Declaration\nof  Conformity  for  each  product  is  required  to  be  made  availa‐\nble for examination upon request.\nLevel 3 conformity is where the products are certified by an\nISO   17065   accredited   independent   third-party   certification\norganization  (CO).  All  product  testing  is  directed  by  the  CO,\nand all changes to the product must be reviewed and retested if\nnecessary.  Compliant  products  are  issued  a  Declaration  of\nTable H.2 Simplified Two-Category, Arc-Rated Clothing System\nClothing\na\nApplicable Situations\nEveryday Work Clothing\nArc-rated long-sleeve shirt with arc-rated pants \n(minimum arc rating of 8) or\nArc-rated coveralls \n(minimum arc rating of 8)\nSituations where a risk assessment indicates that \nPPE is required and where Table 130.7(C)(15)(a) \nand Table 130.7(C)(15)(b) specify arc flash PPE \ncategory 1 or 2\nb\nArc Flash Suit\nA total clothing system consisting of arc-rated \nshirt and pants and/or arc-rated coveralls \nand/or arc flash coat and pants (clothing \nsystem minimum arc rating of 40)\nSituations where a risk assessment indicates that \nPPE is required and where Table 130.7(C)(15)(a) \nand Table 130.7(C)(15)(b) specify arc flash PPE \ncategory 3 or 4\nb\na\nNote that other PPE listed in Table 130.7(C)(15)(c), which include arc-rated face shields or arc flash suit\nhoods, arc-rated hard hat liners, safety glasses or safety goggles, hard hats, hearing protection, heavy-duty\nleather gloves, rubber insulating gloves, and leather protectors, could be required. The arc rating for a\ngarment is expressed in cal/cm\n2\n.\nb\nThe estimated available fault current capacities and fault clearing times or arcing durations are listed in the\ntext of Table 130.7(C)(15)(a) and Table 130.7(C)(15)(b). For power systems with greater than the estimated\navailable fault current capacity or with longer than the assumed fault clearing times, Table H.2 cannot be used\nand arc flash PPE must be determined and selected by means of an incident energy analysis in accordance with\n130.5(G).\nCopyright National Fire Protection Association \nProvided by IHS Markit under license with NFPA\n\n\nINFORMATIVE ANNEX H\n70E–76\nShaded text = Revisions. Δ = Text deletions and figure/table revisions.    • = Section deletions. N = New material.\nConformity by the CO and products are marked with the CO’s\nmark or label.\nH.4.3  Equivalence.  While  there  are  three  levels  of  conformity\nassessment  described  in  ANSI/ISEA  125,  the  levels  are  not  to\nbe considered as equivalent. Users are cautioned that the level\nof  rigor  required  to  demonstrate  conformity  should  be  based\non  the  potential  safety  and  health  consequence  of  using  a\nproduct  that  does  not  meet  a  stated  performance  standard.  A\nhigher potential safety and health consequence associated with\nthe use of a noncompliant product should necessitate a higher\nlevel of conformity assessment.\nH.4.4 Supplier’s  Declaration  of  Conformity.  A  Declaration  of\nConformity  should  be  issued  by  the  supplier  and  made  availa‐\nble  for  examination  upon  request  from  a  customer,  user,  or\nrelevant  authority.  The  Declaration  of  Conformity  should,  at  a\nminimum:\n(1)List the supplier name and address.\n(2)Include  a  product  model  number  or  other  identification\ndetails.\n(3)List   the   product   performance   standard   or   standards\n(designation and year) to which conformance is claimed.\n(4)Include a statement of attestation.\n(5)Be  dated,  written  on  supplier  letterhead,  and  signed  by\nan  authorized  representative.  The  name  and  title  of  the\nauthorized representative should also be printed.\nAdditional information should include:\n(1)The level of conformity followed\n(2)Whether the ISO 17025 testing facility is an independent\nor  in-house  laboratory  (owned  or  partially  owned  by  an\nentity  within  the  supplier’s  corporate  structure  or  within\nthe  manufacturing  stream  for  the  applicable  product,\nincluding subcontractors and sub-suppliers)\n(3)Reference  to  the  test  report  (title,  number,  date,  etc.)\nthat serves as the basis of determining conformity\nFor  an  example  of  a  Supplier’s  Declaration  of  Conformity\nsee Figure H.4.4.\nH.4.5  References.  ANSI/ISEA  contains  detailed  information\nand  guidance  on  the  application  of  the  different  conformity\nassessment  levels.

Electrical  injuries  represent  a  serious  workplace\nhealth and safety issue to electrical and non-electrical workers.\nData  from  the  U.S.  Bureau  of  Labor  Statistics  (BLS)  indicate\nthat  there  were  nearly  6000  fatal  electrical  injuries  to  workers\nin  the  United  States  from  1992  through  2012.  BLS  data  also\nindicate  that  there  were  24,100  non-fatal  electrical  injuries\nfrom  2003  through  2012.  From  1992  to  2013,  the  number  of\nfatal   workplace   electrical   injuries   has   fallen   steadily   and\ndramatically  from  334  in  1992  to  139  in  2013.  However,  the\ntrend   with   non-fatal   electrical   injuries   is   less   consistent.\nBetween  2003  and  2009,  non-fatal  injury  totals  ranged  from\n2390  in  2003  to  2620  in  2009,  with  a  high  of  2950  injuries  in\n2005.  Non-fatal  injury  totals  between  2010  through  2012  were\nthe lowest over this 10-year period, with 1890 non-fatal injuries\nin 2010, 2250 in 2011, and 1700 in 2012.\nThere are two general categories of electrical injury: electri‐\ncal  shock  and  electrical  burns.  Electrical  burns  can  be  further\nsubdivided  into  burns  caused  by  radiant  energy  (arc  burns),\nburns  caused  by  exposure  to  ejected  hot  gases  and  materials\n(thermal  burns),  and  burns  caused  by  the  conduction  of  elec‐\ntrical current through body parts (conduction burns). In addi‐\ntion,  hearing  damage  can  occur  from  acoustic  energy,  and\ntraumatic  injury  can  be  caused  by  toxic  gases  and  pressure\nwaves associated with an arcing event.\nAbout 98 percent of fatal occupational electrical injuries are\nelectrical shock injuries. A corporate case study examining elec‐\ntrical    injury    reporting    and    safety    practices    found    that\n40 percent of electrical incidents involved 250 volts or less and\nwere indicative of a misperception of electrical safety as a high-\nvoltage  issue.  In  addition,  electrical  incidents  once  again  were\nfound  to  involve  a  large  share  of  non-electrical  workers,  with\napproximately  one-half  of  incidents  involving  workers  from\noutside   electrical   crafts.   Research   of   electrical   fatalities   in\nconstruction  found  that  the  highest  proportion  of  fatalities\noccurred  in  establishments  with  10  or  fewer  employees  and\npointed  out  that  smaller  employers  could  have  fewer  formal\ntraining  requirements  and  less  structured  training  in  safety\npractices.\nK.2 Electric  Shock.  Over  40  percent  of  all  electrical  fatalities\nin the U.S. involved overhead power line contact. This includes\noverhead  power  line  fatalities  from  direct  contact  by  a  worker,\ncontact  through  hand-carried  objects,  and  contact  through\nmachines  and  vehicles.  Comparing  the  ratio  of  total  electrical\nfatalities  to  total  electrical  injuries  (fatal  and  nonfatal),  it  was\nnoticed  that  electrical  injuries  are  more  often  fatal  than  many\nother  injury  categories.  For  example,  from  2003  to  2009  there\nwere  20,033  electrical  injuries  of  which  1573  were  fatalities.\nOne  worker  died  for  every  12.74  electrical  injuries.  For  the\nsame  period  there  were  1,718,219  fall  injuries  of  which  5279\nwere fatalities — one worker died for every 325 injuries.\nOf those, 1573 were electrical fatalities. A more detailed look\nat the demographics for 168 electrical fatalities in 2009 showed\nthat 99 percent of deaths were the result of electrocution, and\n70   percent   occurred   while   the   worker   was   performing   a\nconstructing, repairing, or cleaning activity.\nK.3  Arc Flash.  In the recently issued 29 CFR Subpart V, OSHA\nidentified  99  injuries  that  involved  burns  from  arcs  from  ener‐\ngized equipment faults or failures, resulting in 21 fatalities and\n94  hospitalized  injuries  for  the  period  January  1991  through\nDecember 1998.\nBased  on  this  data,  OSHA  estimated  that  an  average  of  at\nleast  eight  burn  injuries  from  arcs  occur  each  year  involving\nemployees  doing  work  covered  by  OSHA  rules,  leading  to\n12  non-fatal  injuries  and  two  fatalities  per  year.  Of  the  reports\nindicating  the  extent  of  the  burn  injury,  75  percent  reported\nthird-degree burns.\nDuring  the  period  involved,  Federal  OSHA  only  required\nnon-fatal  injuries  to  be  reported  when  there  were  three  or\nmore  workers  hospitalized.  OSHA  found  that  there  were  six\ninjuries  for  every  fatality  in  California,  which  requires  the\nreporting of every hospitalized injury.\nUsing  that  data,  OSHA  estimated  that  would  be  at  least\n36  injuries  to  every  fatality,  and  probably  many  more.  Also,\nmany  non-fatal  electric  shocks  involve  burns  from  associated\nelectric arcs.\nStarting January 1, 2015, Federal OSHA requires every hospi‐\ntalized injury to be reported.\nK.4 Arc  Blast.  The  tremendous  temperatures  of  the  arc  cause\nthe  explosive  expansion  of  both  the  surrounding  air  and  the\nmetal in the arc path. For example, copper expands by a factor\nof  67,000  times  when  it  turns  from  a  solid  to  a  vapor.  The\ndanger associated with this expansion is one of high pressures,\nsound,  and  shrapnel.  The  high  pressures  can  easily  exceed\nhundreds or even thousands of pounds per square foot, knock‐\ning  workers  off  ladders,  rupturing  eardrums,  and  collapsing\nlungs.  Finally,  material  and  molten  metal  are  expelled  away\nfrom the arc at speeds exceeding 1120 km/hr (700 mph), fast\nenough for shrapnel to completely penetrate the human body.\nK.5 Other    Information.

N = New material.\nInformative Annex L   Typical Application of Safeguards in the Cell Line Working Zone\nThis informative annex is not a part of the requirements of this NFPA\ndocument but is included for informational purposes only.\nL.1 Application    of    Safeguards.  This    informative    annex\npermits  a  typical  application  of  safeguards  in  electrolytic  areas\nwhere electrical hazards exist. Take, for example, an employee\nworking  on  an  energized  cell.  The  employee  uses  manual\ncontact  to  make  adjustments  and  repairs.  Consequently,  the\nexposed   energized   cell   and   grounded   metal   floor   could\npresent  an  electrical  hazard.  Safeguards  for  this  employee  can\nbe provided in the following ways:\n(1)Protective  boots  can  be  worn  that  isolate  the  employee’s\nfeet from the floor and that provide a safeguard from the\nelectrical hazard.\n(2)Protective gloves can be worn that isolate the employee’s\nhands  from  the  energized  cell  and  that  provide  a  safe‐\nguard.\n(3)If  the  work  task  causes  severe  deterioration,  wear,  or\ndamage  to  personal  protective  equipment  (PPE),  the\nemployee  might  have  to  wear  both  protective  gloves  and\nboots.\n(4)A  permanent  or  temporary  insulating  surface  can  be\nprovided  for  the  employee  to  stand  on  to  provide  a  safe‐\nguard.\n(5)The design of the installation can be modified to provide\na conductive surface for the employee to stand on. If the\nconductive surface is bonded to the cell, a safeguard will\nbe provided by voltage equalization.\n(6)Safe  work  practices  can  provide  safeguards.  If  protective\nboots  are  worn,  the  employee  should  not  make  long\nreaches over energized (or grounded) surfaces such that\nhis  or  her  elbow  bypasses  the  safeguard.  If  such  move‐\nments are required, protective sleeves, protective mats, or\nspecial  tools  should  be  used.  Training  on  the  nature  of\nelectrical  hazards  and  proper  use  and  condition  of  safe‐\nguards is, in itself, a safeguard.\n(7)The energized cell can be temporarily bonded to ground.\nL.2 Electrical  Power  Receptacles.  Power  supply  circuits  and\nreceptacles in the cell line area for portable electric equipment\nshould  meet  the  requirements  of  668.21  of  NFPA  70,  National\nElectrical Code. However, it is recommended that receptacles for\nportable electric equipment not be installed in electrolytic cell\nareas  and  that  only  pneumatic-powered  portable  tools  and\nequipment be used.\nCopyright National Fire Protection Association \nProvided by IHS Markit under license with NFPA\n\n\nINFORMATIVE ANNEX M\nShaded text = Revisions.

The  use  of\nall arc-rated clothing layers will result in achieving the required\narc rating with the lowest number of layers and lowest clothing\nsystem  weight.  Garments  that  are  not  arc  rated  should  not  be\nused  to  increase  the  arc  rating  of  a  garment  or  of  a  clothing\nsystem.\nM.1.2 A total system of protective clothing can be determined\nto  take  credit  for  the  protection  provided  by  all  the  layers  of\nclothing that are worn\n if tested as a combination. For example,\nto  achieve  an  arc  rating  of  40  cal/cm\n2\n  (167.5  J/cm\n2\n),  an  arc\nflash suit with an arc rating of 40 cal/cm\n2\n (167.5 J/cm\n2\n) could\nbe  worn  over  a  cotton  shirt  and  cotton  pants.  Alternatively,  an\narc flash suit with a 25 cal/cm\n2\n (104.7 J/cm\n2\n) arc rating could\nbe worn over an arc-rated shirt and arc-rated pants with an arc\nrating  of  8  cal/cm\n2\n  (33.5  J/cm\n2\n)  to  achieve  a  total  system  arc\nrating   of   40   cal/cm\n2\n   (167.5   J/cm\n2\n).   This   latter   approach\nprovides  the  required  arc  rating  at  a  lower  weight  and  with\nfewer  total  layers  of  fabric  and,  consequently,  would  provide\nthe required protection with a higher level of worker comfort.\nM.2 Layering  Using  Arc-Rated  Clothing  over  Natural  Fiber\nClothing Underlayers.\nM.2.1  Under  some  exposure  conditions,  natural  fiber  under‐\nlayers  can  ignite  even  when  they  are  worn  under  arc-rated\nclothing.\nM.2.2  If  the  arc  flash  exposure  is  sufficient  to  break  open  all\nthe  arc-rated  clothing  outerlayer  or  underlayers,  the  natural\nfiber underlayer can ignite and cause more severe burn injuries\nto  an  expanded  area  of  the  body.  This  is  due  to  the  natural\nfiber underlayers burning onto areas of the worker’s body that\nwere  not  exposed  by  the  arc  flash  event.  This  can  occur  when\nthe natural fiber underlayer continues to burn underneath arc-\nrated clothing layers even in areas in which the arc-rated cloth‐\ning  layer  or  layers  are  not  broken  open  due  to  a  “chimney\neffect.”\nM.3  Total System Arc Rating.\nM.3.1  The  total  system  arc  rating  is  the  arc  rating  obtained\nwhen all clothing layers worn by a worker are tested as a multi‐\nlayer  test  sample.  An  example  of  a  clothing  system  is  an  arc-\nrated  coverall  worn  over  an  arc-rated  shirt  and  arc-rated  pants\nin which all of the garments are constructed from the same arc-\nrated fabric. For this two-layer arc-rated clothing system, the arc\nrating  would  typically  be  more  than  three  times  higher  than\nthe arc ratings of the individual layers; that is, if the arc ratings\nof  the  arc-rated  coverall,  shirt,  and  pants  were  all  in  the  range\nof  5  cal/cm\n2\n  (20.9  J/cm\n2\n)  to  6  cal/cm\n2\n  (25.1  J/cm\n2\n),  the  total\ntwo-layer   system   arc   rating   would   be   over   20   cal/cm\n2\n(83.7 J/cm\n2\n).\nM.3.2  It  is  important  to  understand  that  the  total  system  arc\nrating  cannot  be  determined  by  adding  the  arc  ratings  of  the\nindividual  layers.  In  a  few  cases,  it  has  been  observed  that  the\ntotal  system  arc  rating  actually  decreased  when  another  arc-\nrated  layer  of  a  specific  type  was  added  to  the  system  as  the\noutermost layer. The only way to determine the total system arc\nrating is to conduct a multilayer arc test on the combination of\nall of the layers assembled as they would be worn.\nCopyright National Fire Protection Association \nProvided by IHS Markit under license with NFPA\n\n\nINFORMATIVE ANNEX N\n70E–86\nShaded text = Revisions. Δ = Text deletions and figure/table revisions.    • = Section deletions. N = New material.\nInformative Annex N   Example Industrial Procedures and Policies for Working Near Overhead\nElectrical Lines and Equipment\nThis informative annex is not a part of the requirements of this NFPA\ndocument but is included for informational purposes only.\nN.1  Introduction.  This informative annex is an example of an\nindustrial   procedure   for   working   near   overhead   electrical\nsystems.  Areas  covered  include  operations  that  could  expose\nemployees  or  equipment  to  contact  with  overhead  electrical\nsystems.\nWhen  working  near  electrical  lines  or  equipment,  avoid\ndirect  or  indirect  contact.  Direct  contact  is  contact  with  any\npart  of  the  body.  Indirect  contact  is  when  part  of  the  body\ntouches  or  is  in  dangerous  proximity  to  any  object  in  contact\nwith   energized   electrical   equipment.   The   following   two\nassumptions should always be made:\n(1)Lines are “live” (energized).\n(2)Lines are operating at high voltage (over 1000 volts).\nAs  the  voltage  increases,  the  minimum  working  clearances\nincrease.  Through  arc-over,  injuries  or  fatalities  could  occur,\neven  if  actual  contact  with  high-voltage  lines  or  equipment  is\nnot made. Potential for arc-over increases as the voltage increa‐\nses.\nN.2 Overhead   Power   Line   Policy   (OPP).  This   informative\nannex applies to all overhead conductors, regardless of voltage,\nand requires the following:\n(1)That  employees  not  place  themselves  in  close  proximity\nto  overhead  power  lines.  “Close  proximity”  is  within  a\ndistance  of  3  m  (10  ft)  for  systems  up  to  50  kV,  and\nshould be increased 100 mm (4 in.) for every 10 kV above\n50 kV.\n(2)That  employees  be  informed  of  the  hazards  and  precau‐\ntions when working near overhead lines.\n(3)That  warning  decals  be  posted  on  cranes  and  similar\nequipment  regarding  the  minimum  clearance  of  3  m\n(10 ft).\n(4)That  a  “spotter”  be  designated  when  equipment  is  work‐\ning  near  overhead  lines.  This  person’s  responsibility  is  to\nobserve safe working clearances around all overhead lines\nand to direct the operator accordingly.\n(5)That  warning  cones  be  used  as  visible  indicators  of  the\n3  m  (10  ft)  safety  zone  when  working  near  overhead\npower lines.\nInformational  Note:  “Working  near,”  for  the  purpose  of  this\ninformative annex, is defined as working within a distance from\nany  overhead  power  line  that  is  less  than  the  combined  height\nor  length  of  the  lifting  device  plus  the  associated  load  length\nand  the  required  minimum  clearance  distance  [as  stated  in\nN.2(1)]. Required clearance is expressed as follows:\nRequired  clearance  =  lift  equipment  height  or  length  +  load\nlength + at least 3 m (10 ft)\n(6)That  the  local  responsible  person  be  notified  at  least\n24 hours before any work begins to allow time to identify\nvoltages  and  clearances  or  to  place  the  line  in  an  electri‐\ncally safe work condition.\nN.3  Policy.  All  employees  and  contractors  shall  conform  to\nthe  OPP.  The  first  line  of  defense  in  preventing  electrical\ncontact  accidents  is  to  remain  outside  the  limited  approach\nboundary.  Because  most  company  and  contractor  employees\nare not qualified to determine the system voltage level, a quali‐\nfied  person  shall  be  called  to  establish  voltages  and  minimum\nclearances and take appropriate action to make the work zone\nsafe.\nN.4  Procedures.\nN.4.1  General.  Prior to the start of all operations where poten‐\ntial  contact  with  overhead  electrical  systems  is  possible,  the\nperson  in  charge  shall  identify  overhead  lines  or  equipment,\nreference  their  location  with  respect  to  prominent  physical\nfeatures,  or  physically  mark  the  area  directly  in  front  of  the\noverhead  lines  with  safety  cones,  survey  tape,  or  other  means.\nElectrical  line  location  shall  be  discussed  at  a  pre-work  safety\nmeeting  of  all  employees  on  the  job  (through  a  job  briefing).\nAll company employees and contractors shall attend this meet‐\ning and require their employees to conform to electrical safety\nstandards.  New  or  transferred  employees  shall  be  informed  of\nelectrical hazards and proper procedures during orientations.\nOn  construction  projects,  the  contractor  shall  identify  and\nreference  all  potential  electrical  hazards  and  document  such\nactions  with  the  on-site  employers.  The  location  of  overhead\nelectrical  lines  and  equipment  shall  be  conspicuously  marked\nby  the  person  in  charge.  New  employees  shall  be  informed  of\nelectrical hazards and of proper precautions and procedures.\nWhere there is potential for contact with overhead electrical\nsystems,  local  area  management  shall  be  called  to  decide\nwhether to place the line in an electrically safe work condition\nor  to  otherwise  protect  the  line  against  unintentional  contact.\nWhere  there  is  a  suspicion  of  lines  with  low  clearance  [height\nunder  6  m  (20  ft)],  the  local  on-site  electrical  supervisor  shall\nbe notified to verify and take appropriate action.\nAll electrical contact incidents, including “near misses,” shall\nbe reported to the local area health and safety specialist.\nN.4.2 Look  Up  and  Live  Flags.  In  order  to  prevent  uninten‐\ntional  contact  with  all  aerial  lifts,  cranes,  boom  trucks,  service\nrigs,  and  similar  equipment  shall  use  look  up  and  live  flags.\nThe  flags  are  visual  indicators  that  the  equipment  is  currently\nbeing used or has been returned to its “stowed or cradled” posi‐\ntion.  The  flags  shall  be  yellow  with  black  lettering  and  shall\nstate in bold lettering “LOOK UP AND LIVE.”\nThe procedure for the use of the flag follows.\n(1)When the boom or lift is in its stowed or cradled position,\nthe flag shall be located on the load hook or boom end.\n(2)Prior to operation of the boom or lift, the operator of the\nequipment  shall  assess  the  work  area  to  determine  the\nlocation of all overhead lines and communicate this infor‐\nmation to all crews on site. Once completed, the operator\nshall  remove  the  flag  from  the  load  hook  or  boom  and\ntransfer  the  flag  to  the  steering  wheel  of  the  vehicle.\nOnce the flag is placed on the steering wheel, the opera‐\ntor can begin to operate the equipment.\n(3)After successfully completing the work activity and return‐\ning  the  equipment  to  its  stowed  or  cradled  position,  the\noperator shall return the flag to the load hook.\nCopyright National Fire Protection Association \nProvided by IHS Markit under license with NFPA\n\n\nINFORMATIVE ANNEX N\nShaded text = Revisions.

N = New material.\n70E–87\n(4)The  operator  of  the  equipment  is  responsible  for  the\nplacement of the look up and live flag.\nN.4.3  High Risk Tasks.\nN.4.3.1 Heavy  Mobile  Equipment.  Prior  to  the  start  of  each\nworkday,  a  high-visibility  marker  (orange  safety  cones  or  other\ndevices) shall be temporarily placed on the ground to mark the\nlocation of overhead wires. The supervisors shall discuss electri‐\ncal  safety  with  appropriate  crew  members  at  on-site  tailgate\nsafety talks. When working in the proximity of overhead lines, a\nspotter  shall  be  positioned  in  a  conspicuous  location  to  direct\nmovement  and  observe  for  contact  with  the  overhead  wires.\nThe  spotter,  equipment  operator,  and  all  other  employees\nworking  on  the  job  location  shall  be  alert  for  overhead  wires\nand remain at least 3 m (10 ft) from the mobile equipment.\nAll  mobile  equipment  shall  display  a  warning  decal  regard‐\ning  electrical  contact.  Independent  truck  drivers  delivering\nmaterials  to  field  locations  shall  be  cautioned  about  overhead\nelectrical  lines  before  beginning  work,  and  a  properly  trained\non-site or contractor employee shall assist in the loading or off-\nloading  operation.  Trucks  that  have  emptied  their  material\nshall not leave the work location until the boom, lift, or box is\ndown and is safely secured.\nN.4.3.2 Aerial  Lifts,  Cranes,  and  Boom  Devices.  Where  there\nis  potential  for  near  operation  or  contact  with  overhead  lines\nor  equipment,  work  shall  not  begin  until  a  safety  meeting  is\nconducted  and  appropriate  steps  are  taken  to  identify,  mark,\nand  warn  against  unintentional  contact.  The  supervisor  will\nreview operations daily to ensure compliance.\nWhere  the  operator’s  visibility  is  impaired,  a  spotter  shall\nguide  the  operator.  Hand  signals  shall  be  used  and  clearly\nunderstood  between  the  operator  and  spotter.  When  visual\ncontact  is  impaired,  the  spotter  and  operator  shall  be  in  radio\ncontact. Aerial lifts, cranes, and boom devices shall have appro‐\npriate  warning  decals  and  shall  use  warning  cones  or  similar\ndevices  to  indicate  the  location  of  overhead  lines  and  identify\nthe 3 m (10 ft) minimum safe working boundary.\nN.4.3.3  Tree Work.  Wires shall be treated as live and operating\nat high voltage until verified as otherwise by the local area on-\nsite   employer.   The   local   maintenance   organization   or   an\napproved electrical contractor shall remove branches touching\nwires  before  work  begins.  Limbs  and  branches  shall  not  be\ndropped  onto  overhead  wires.  If  limbs  or  branches  fall  across\nelectrical  wires,  all  work  shall  stop  immediately  and  the  local\narea  maintenance  organization  is  to  be  called.  When  climbing\nor working in trees, pruners shall try to position themselves so\nthat the trunk or limbs are between their bodies and electrical\nwires.  If  possible,  pruners  shall  not  work  with  their  backs\ntoward electrical wires. An insulated bucket truck is the prefer‐\nred method of pruning when climbing poses a greater threat of\nelectrical  contact.  Personal  protective  equipment  (PPE)  shall\nbe used while working on or near lines.\nN.4.4 Underground  Electrical  Lines  and  Equipment.  Before\nexcavation  starts  and  where  there  exists  reasonable  possibility\nof  contacting  electrical  or  utility  lines  or  equipment,  the  local\narea supervision (or USA DIG organization, when appropriate)\nshall  be  called  and  a  request  is  to  be  made  for  identifying/\nmarking the line location(s).\nWhen USA DIG is called, their representatives will need the\nfollowing:\n(1)Minimum  of  two  working  days’  notice  prior  to  start  of\nwork, name of county, name of city, name and number of\nstreet or highway marker, and nearest intersection\n(2)Type of work\n(3)Date and time work is to begin\n(4)Caller’s name, contractor/department name and address\n(5)Telephone number for contact\n(6)Special instructions\nUtilities  that  do  not  belong  to  USA  DIG  must  be  contacted\nseparately.  USA  DIG  might  not  have  a  complete  list  of  utility\nowners.  Utilities  that  are  discovered  shall  be  marked  before\nwork  begins.

This  policy  requires  that  all  vehicles  with  loads  in\nexcess  of  4.25  m  (14  ft)  in  height  use  specific  procedures  to\nmaintain  safe  working  clearances  when  in  transit  below  over‐\nhead lines.\nThe specific procedures for moving loads in excess of 4.25 m\n(14 ft) in height or via routes with lower clearance heights are\nas follows:\n(1)Prior to movement of any load in excess of 4.25 m (14 ft)\nin  height,  the  local  health  and  safety  department,  along\nwith  the  local  person  in  charge,  shall  be  notified  of  the\nequipment move.\n(2)An  on-site  electrician,  electrical  construction  representa‐\ntive,  or  qualified  electrical  contractor  should  check  the\nintended route to the next location before relocation.\n(3)The  new  site  is  to  be  checked  for  overhead  lines  and\nclearances.\n(4)Power lines and communication lines shall be noted, and\nextreme care used when traveling beneath the lines.\n(5)The company moving the load or equipment will provide\na  driver  responsible  for  measuring  each  load  and  ensur‐\ning   each   load   is   secured   and   transported   in   a   safe\nmanner.\n(6)An  on-site  electrician,  electrical  construction  representa‐\ntive, or qualified electrical contractor shall escort the first\nload  to  the  new  location,  ensuring  safe  clearances,  and  a\nservice  company  representative  shall  be  responsible  for\nsubsequent loads to follow the same safe route.\nIf proper working clearances cannot be maintained, the job\nmust be shut down until a safe route can be established or the\nnecessary repairs or relocations have been completed to ensure\nthat a safe working clearance has been achieved.\nAll  work  requiring  movement  of  loads  in  excess  of  4.25  m\n(14 ft) in height are required to begin only after a general work\npermit  has  been  completed  detailing  all  pertinent  information\nabout the move.\nN.4.6 Emergency  Response.  If  an  overhead  line  falls  or  is\ncontacted, the following precautions should be taken:\n(1)Keep everyone at least 3 m (10 ft) away.\n(2)Use  flagging  to  protect  motorists,  spectators,  and  other\nindividuals from fallen or low wires.\n(3)Call  the  local  area  electrical  department  or  electric  util‐\nity immediately.\n(4)Place barriers around the area.\n(5)Do not attempt to move the wire(s).\n(6)Do not touch anything that is touching the wire(s).\n(7)Be alert to water or other conductors present.\nCopyright National Fire Protection Association \nProvided by IHS Markit under license with NFPA\n\n\nINFORMATIVE ANNEX N\n70E–88\nShaded text = Revisions.

This    informative    annex    addresses    the\nresponsibilities   of   the   facility   owner   or   manager   or   the\nemployer  having  responsibility  for  facility  ownership  or  opera‐\ntions  management  to  perform  a  risk  assessment  during  the\ndesign of electrical systems and installations.\nO.1.1  This  informative  annex  covers  employee  safety-related\ndesign  concepts  for  electrical  equipment  and  installations  in\nworkplaces covered by the scope of this standard. This informa‐\ntive annex discusses design considerations that have impact on\nthe application of the safety-related work practices only.\nO.1.2  This  informative  annex  does  not  discuss  specific  design\nrequirements.  The  facility  owner  or  manager  or  the  employer\nshould choose design options that eliminate hazards or reduce\nrisk and enhance the effectiveness of safety-related work practi‐\nces.\nO.2  General Design Considerations.\nO.2.1  Employers,   facility   owners,   and   managers   who   have\nresponsibility  for  facilities  and  installations  having  electrical\nenergy as a potential hazard to employees and other personnel\nshould   ensure   that   electrical   hazard   risk   assessments   are\nperformed  during  the  design  of  electrical  systems  and  installa‐\ntions.\nO.2.2  Design  option  decisions  should  facilitate  the  ability  to\neliminate hazards or reduce risk by doing the following:\n(1)Reducing the likelihood of exposure\n(2)Reducing the magnitude or severity of exposure\n(3)Enabling  achievement  of  an  electrically  safe  work  condi‐\ntion\nO.2.3 Incident   Energy   Reduction   Methods.  The   following\nmethods  have  proved  to  be  effective  in  reducing  incident\nenergy:\n(1)Zone-selective  interlocking.  This  is  a  method  that  allows\ntwo  or  more  circuit  breakers  to  communicate  with  each\nother  so  that  a  short  circuit  or  ground  fault  will  be\ncleared  by  the  breaker  closest  to  the  fault  with  no  inten‐\ntional delay. Clearing the fault in the shortest time aids in\nreducing the incident energy.\n(2)Differential   relaying.   The   concept   of   this   protection\nmethod is that current flowing into protected equipment\nmust equal the current out of the equipment. If these two\ncurrents are not equal, a fault must exist within the equip‐\nment,  and  the  relaying  can  be  set  to  operate  for  a  fast\ninterruption. Differential relaying uses current transform‐\ners  located  on  the  line  and  load  sides  of  the  protected\nequipment and fast acting relay.\n(3)Energy-reducing   maintenance   switching   with   a   local\nstatus  indicator.  An  energy-reducing  maintenance  switch\nallows a worker to set a circuit breaker trip unit to operate\nfaster  while  the  worker  is  working  within  an  arc  flash\nboundary,  as  defined  in  NFPA  70E,  and  then  to  set  the\ncircuit  breaker  back  to  a  normal  setting  after  the  work  is\ncomplete.\n(4)Energy-reducing  active  arc  flash  mitigation  system.  This\nsystem  can  reduce  the  arcing  duration  by  creating  a  low\nimpedance   current   path,   located   within   a   controlled\ncompartment,  to  cause  the  arcing  fault  to  transfer  to  the\nnew  current  path,  while  the  upstream  breaker  clears  the\ncircuit.  The  system  works  without  compromising  existing\nselective   coordination   in   the   electrical   distribution\nsystem.\n(5)Energy-reducing  line  side  isolation.  This  is  equipment\nthat  encloses  the  line  side  conductors  and  circuit  parts\nand  has  been  listed  to  provide  both  shock  and  arc  flash\nprotection  from  events  on  the  line  side  of  a  circuit\nbreaker or switch.\n(6)Arc  flash  relay.  An  arc  flash  relay  typically  uses  light\nsensors to detect the light produced by an arc flash event.\nOnce  a  certain  level  of  light  is  detected,  the  relay  will\nissue a trip signal to an upstream overcurrent device.\n(7)High-resistance  grounding.  A  great  majority  of  electrical\nfaults  are  of  the  phase-to-ground  type.  High-resistance\ngrounding will insert an impedance in the ground return\npath   and   will   typically   limit   the   fault   current   to\n10  amperes  and  below  (at  5  kV  nominal  or  below),  leav‐\ning  insufficient  fault  energy  and  thereby  helping  reduce\nthe arc flash hazard level. High-resistance grounding will\nnot  affect  arc  flash  energy  for  line-to-line  or  line-to-line-\nto-line arcs.\n(8)Current-limiting devices. Current-limiting protective devi‐\nces reduce incident energy by clearing the fault faster and\nby  reducing  the  current  seen  at  the  arc  source.  The\nenergy reduction becomes effective for current above the\ncurrent-limiting  threshold  of  the  current-limiting  fuse  or\ncurrent limiting circuit breaker.\n(9)Shunt-trip.  Adding  a  shunt-trip  that  is  signaled  to  open\nfrom  an  open-fuse  relay  to  switches  800  amperes  and\ngreater  reduces  incident  energy  by  opening  the  switch\nimmediately when the first fuse opens. The reduced clear‐\ning  time  reduces  incident  energy.  This  is  especially  help‐\nful  for  arcing  currents  that  are  not  within  the  current-\nlimiting threshold of the three current-limiting fuses.\nΔO.2.4 Additional   Safety-by-Design   Methods.  The   following\nmethods have proven to be effective in reducing risk associated\nwith an arc flash or shock hazard:\n(1)Installing finger-safe components, covers, and insulating\nbarriers reduces exposure to energized parts.\n(2)Installing  disconnects  within  sight  of  each  motor  or\ndriven  machine  increases  the  likelihood  that  the  equip‐\nment will be put into an electrically safe work condition\nbefore work has begun.\n(3)Installing current limiting cable limiters can help reduce\nincident energy. Additionally, cable limiters can be used\nto  provide  short-circuit  protection  (and  therefore  inci‐\ndent  energy  reduction)  for  feeder  tap  conductors  that\nare  protected  at  up  to  10  times  their  ampacity,  a  situa‐\ntion where the tap conductor can easily vaporize.\n(4)Installing  inspection  windows  for  noncontact  inspection\nreduces the need to open doors or remove covers.\n(5)Installing  a  single  service  fused  disconnect  switch  or\ncircuit  breaker  provides  protection  for  buses  that  would\nbe unprotected if six disconnect switches are used.\nCopyright National Fire Protection Association \nProvided by IHS Markit under license with NFPA\n\n\nINFORMATIVE ANNEX O\n70E–90\nShaded text = Revisions.

Injuries  from  electrical  energy  are  a  significant\ncause  of  occupational  fatalities  in  the  workplace  in  the  United\nStates.  This  standard  specifies  requirements  unique  to  the\nhazards  of  electrical  energy.  By  itself,  however,  this  standard\ndoes  not  constitute  a  comprehensive  and  effective  electrical\nsafety  program.  The  most  effective  application  of  the  require‐\nments of this standard can be achieved within the framework of\na  recognized  health  and  safety  management  system.  ANSI/\nAIHA  Z10,  American  National  Standard  for  Occupational  Health\nand  Safety  Management  Systems,  and  ISO  45001,  Occupational\nHealth  and  Safety  Management  Systems  —  Requirements  with  Guid‐\nance for Use, provides comprehensive guidance on the elements\nof  an  effective  health  and  safety  management  system  and  are\nrecognized standards. ANSI/AIHA Z10 and IS0 45001 are simi‐\nlar   to   other   internationally   recognized   standards,   such   as\nANSI/ISO  14001,  Environmental  Management  Systems  —  Require‐\nments  with  Guidance  for  Use.  Some  companies  and  other  organi‐\nzations have proprietary health and safety management systems\nthat are aligned with the key elements of ANSI/AIHA Z10 and\nISO 45001.\nThe most effective design and implementation of an electri‐\ncal  safety  program  can  be  achieved  through  a  joint  effort\ninvolving  electrical  subject  matter  experts  and  safety  professio‐\nnals knowledgeable about safety management systems.\nSuch   collaboration   can   help   ensure   that   proven   safety\nmanagement principles and practices applicable to any hazard\nin  the  workplace  are  appropriately  incorporated  into  the  elec‐\ntrical safety program.\nThis informative annex provides guidance on implementing\nthis  standard  within  the  framework  of  ANSI/AIHA  Z10  and\nISO 45001 and other recognized or proprietary comprehensive\noccupational health and safety management system standards.\nCopyright National Fire Protection Association \nProvided by IHS Markit under license with NFPA\n\n\nINFORMATIVE ANNEX Q\n70E–92\nShaded text = Revisions. Δ = Text deletions and figure/table revisions.    • = Section deletions. N = New material.\nInformative Annex Q   Human Performance and Workplace Electrical Safety\nThis informative annex is not a part of the requirements of this NFPA\ndocument but is included for informational purposes only.\nQ.1  Introduction.  This   annex   introduces   the   concept   of\nhuman  performance  and  how  this  concept  can  be  applied  to\nworkplace electrical safety.\nHuman  performance  is  an  aspect  of  risk  management  that\naddresses  organizational,  leader,  and  individual  performance\nas factors that either lead to or prevent errors and their events.\nThe objective of human performance is to identify and address\nhuman   error   and   its   negative   consequences   on   people,\nprograms,  processes,  the  work  environment,  an  organization,\nor equipment.\nStudies  by  high-risk  industries  indicate  that  human  error  is\noften  a  root  cause  of  incidents.  The  premise  of  this  annex  is\nthat human error is similarly a frequent root cause of electrical\nincidents. In occupational health and safety terms, an incident\nis  an  occurrence  arising  in  the  course  of  work  that  resulted  in\nor  could  have  resulted  in  an  injury,  illness,  damage  to  health,\nor a fatality (see ANSI/AIHA Z10-2012, Definition of Incident).\nThe hierarchy of risk control methods identified in this and\nother standards is:\n(1)Eliminating the hazard\n(2)Substituting other materials, processes, or equipment\n(3)Using engineering controls\n(4)Establishing  systems  that  increase  awareness  of  potential\nhazards\n(5)Setting  administrative  controls,  e.g.,  training  and  proce‐\ndures, instructions, and scheduling\n(6)Using  PPE,  including  measures  to  ensure  its  appropriate\nselection, use, and maintenance\nThe  purpose  of  these  controls  is  to  either  reduce  the  likeli‐\nhood  of  an  incident  occurring  or  to  prevent  or  mitigate  the\nseverity  of  consequence  if  an  incident  occurs.  No  control  is\ninfallible.  All  of  the  controls  are  subject  to  errors  in  human\nperformance,  whether  at  the  design,  implementation,  or  use\nphase.\nHuman performance addresses managing human error as a\nunique  control  that  is  complementary  to  the  hierarchy  of  risk\ncontrol methods.\nQ.2 Principles  of  Human  Performance.  The  following  are\nbasic principles of human performance:\n(1)People   are   fallible,   and   even   the   best   people   make\nmistakes.\n(2)Error-likely   situations   and   conditions   are   predictable,\nmanageable, and preventable.\n(3)Individual  performance  is  influenced  by  organizational\nprocesses and values.\n(4)People   achieve   high   levels   of   performance   largely\nbecause    of    the    encouragement    and    reinforcement\nreceived from leaders, peers, and subordinates.\n(5)Incidents  can  be  avoided  through  an  understanding  of\nthe reasons mistakes occur and application of the lessons\nlearned from past incidents.\nQ.3 Information     Processing     and     Attention.  The     brain\nprocesses information in a series of interactive stages:\n(1)Attention — where and to what we intentionally or unin‐\ntentionally direct our concentration.\n(2)Sensing  —  sensory  inputs  (hearing,  seeing,  touching,\nsmelling, etc.) receive and transfer information.\n(3)Encoding,  storage,  thinking  —  incoming  information  is\nencoded and stored for later use in decision making (i.e.,\nwhat  to  do  with  information).  This  stage  of  information\nprocessing   involves   interaction   between   the   working\nmemory and long-term memory (capabilities, knowledge,\npast experiences, opinions, and perspectives).\n(4)Retrieval,  acting  —  taking  physical  human  action  based\non the synthesis of attention, sensation, encoded informa‐\ntion, thinking, and decision-making. In a workplace envi‐\nronment  this  would  include  changing  the  state  of  a\ncomponent  using  controls,  tools,  and  computers,  includ‐\ning verbal statements to inform or direct others.\nAccording  to  Rasmussen’s  model  used  to  classify  human\nerror,   workers   operate   in   one   or   more   of   three   human\nperformance  modes:  rule-based  mode,  skill-based  mode,  and\nknowledge-based mode.\nNote: See Rasmussen, J. (1983); Skills, rules, and knowledge;\nsignals,  signs,  and  symbols,  and  other  distinctions  in  human\nperformance  models.  IEEE  Transactions  on  Systems,  Man,  and\nCybernetics, (3), 257-266.\nReason’s   Human   Performance   Generic   Error   Modeling\nSystem  is  an  extension  of  Rasmussen’s  model.  An  individual\nconsciously  or  subconsciously  selects  a  human  performance\nmode  based  on  his  or  her  perception  of  the  situation.  This\nperception  is  usually  a  function  of  the  individual’s  familiarity\nwith  a  specific  task  and  the  level  of  attention  (information\nprocessing) applied to accomplish the activity.\nNote:    See    Reason,    J.    Human    Error.    Cambridge,    UK:\nCambridge University Press, 1990.\nMost  cognitive  psychologists  agree  that  humans  have  a  limi‐\nted  pool  of  attentional  resources  available  to  divide  up  among\ntasks.  This  pool  of  shared  attentional  resources  enables  the\nmind  to  process  information  while  performing  one  or  some‐\ntimes   multiple   tasks.   Some   tasks   require   more   attentional\nresources  than  others.  The  amount  of  attentional  resource\nrequired  to  perform  a  task  satisfactorily  defines  the  mental\nworkload for an individual and is inversely proportional to the\nindividual’s familiarity with the task. An increase in knowledge,\nskill,  and  experience  with  a  task  decreases  the  level  of  atten‐\ntional  resources  required  to  perform  that  task  and  therefore\ndecreases  the  level  of  attentional  resource  allocated  to  that\ntask.\nCritical  points  in  activities  when  risk  is  higher  (increased\nlikelihood  of  harm  or  increased  severity  of  harm,  or  both)\nrequire an increased allocation of attentional resources. Alloca‐\ntion at these critical points can be improved by training, proce‐\ndures, equipment design, and teamwork.\nEach   human   performance   mode   has   associated   errors.\nAwareness  of  which  human  performance  mode  the  individual\nmight  be  in  helps  identify  the  kind  of  errors  that  could  be\nmade  and  which  error  prevention  techniques  would  be  the\nmost effective.\nCopyright National Fire Protection Association \nProvided by IHS Markit under license with NFPA\n\n\nINFORMATIVE ANNEX Q\nShaded text = Revisions.

N = New material.\n70E–93\nQ.4  Human Performance Modes and Associated Errors.\nQ.4.1  Rule-Based Human Performance Mode.\nQ.4.1.1  General.  An  individual  operates  in  rule-based  human\nperformance mode when the work situation is likely to be one\nthat  he  or  she  has  encountered  before  or  has  been  trained  to\ndeal  with,  or  which  is  covered  by  a  procedure.  It  is  called  the\nrule-based  mode  because  the  individual  applies  memorized  or\nwritten  rules.  These  rules  might  have  been  learned  as  a  result\nof interaction at the workplace, through formal training, or by\nworking with experienced workers.\nThe level of required attentional resources when in the rule-\nbased mode fits between that of the knowledge- and skill-based\nmodes. The time devoted to processing the information (reac‐\ntion  time)  to  select  an  appropriate  response  to  the  work  situa‐\ntion is in the order of seconds.\nThe  rule-based  level  follows  an  IF  (symptom  X),  THEN\n(situation  Y)  logic.  The  individual  operates  by  matching  the\nsigns and symptoms of the situation to some stored knowledge\nstructure, and will usually react in a predicable manner.\nIn human performance theory, rule-based is the most desira‐\nble  performance  mode.  The  individual  can  use  conscious\nthinking  to  challenge  whether  or  not  the  proposed  solution  is\nappropriate.  This  can  result  in  additional  error  prevention\nbeing integrated into the solution.\nNot  all  activities  guided  by  a  procedure  are  necessarily\nexecuted  in  rule-based  mode.  An  experienced  worker  might\nunconsciously default to the skill-based mode when executing a\nprocedure that is normally done in the rule-based mode.\nQ.4.1.2 Rule-Based  Human  Performance  Mode  Errors.  Since\nthe  rule-based  human  performance  mode  requires  interpreta‐\ntion  using  an  \"if-then\"  logic,  misinterpretation  is  the  prevalent\ntype  error  mode.  Errors  involve  deviating  from  an  approved\nprocedure, applying the wrong response to a work situation, or\napplying the correct procedure to the wrong situation.\nQ.4.2  Knowledge-Based Human Performance Mode.\nQ.4.2.1  General.  A    worker    operates    in    knowledge-based\nhuman  performance  mode  when  there  is  uncertainty  about\nwhat  to  do;  no  skill  or  rule  is  readily  identifiable.  The  individ‐\nual  relies  on  their  understanding  and  knowledge  of  the  situa‐\ntion  and  related  scientific  principles  and  fundamental  theory\nto develop an appropriate response. Uncertainty creates a need\nfor  information.  To  gather  information  more  effectively,  the\nindividual’s   attentional   resources   become   more   focused.\nThinking  takes  more  effort  and  energy,  and  the  time  devoted\nto processing the information to select an appropriate response\nto the situation can be in the order of minutes to hours.\nQ.4.2.2 Knowledge-Based  Human  Performance  Mode  Errors.\nThe prevalent error when operating in knowledge-based mode\nis  that  decisions  are  often  based  on  an  inaccurate  mental\npicture   of   the   work   situation.   Knowledge-based   activities\nrequire  decision  making  based  on  diagnosis  and  problem-\nsolving.  Humans  do  not  usually  perform  optimally  in  high-\nstress,  unfamiliar  situations  where  they  are  required  to  “think\non their feet” in the absence of rules, routines, and procedures\nto  handle  the  situation.  The  tendency  is  to  use  only  informa‐\ntion  that  is  readily  available  to  evaluate  the  situation  and  to\nbecome  enmeshed  in  one  aspect  of  the  problem  to  the  exclu‐\nsion  of  all  other  considerations.  Decision-making  is  erroneous\nif  problem-solving  is  based  on  incomplete  or  inaccurate  infor‐\nmation.\nQ.4.3  Skill-Based Human Performance Mode.\nQ.4.3.1  General.  A person is in skill-based mode when execut‐\ning a task that involves practiced actions in a very familiar and\ncommon situation. Human performance is governed by mental\ninstructions  developed  by  either  practice  or  experience  and  is\nless  dependent  on  external  conditions.  The  time  devoted  to\nprocessing the information is in the order of milliseconds. Writ‐\ning  one’s  signature  is  an  example  of  skill-based  performance\nmode. A familiar workplace procedure is typically performed in\nskill-based  performance  mode,  such  as  the  operation  of  a  low-\nvoltage molded case circuit breaker.\nQ.4.3.2 Skill-Based  Human  Performance  Mode  Errors.  The\nrelatively  low  demand  on  attentional  resources  required  when\nan  individual  is  in  skill-based  human  performance  mode  can\ncreate the following errors:\n(1)Inattention:  Skill-based  performance  mode  errors  are\nprimarily  execution  errors  involving  omissions  triggered\nby  human  variability,  or  not  recognizing  changes  in  task\nrequirements or work conditions related to the task.\n(2)Perceived  reduction  in  risk:  As  familiarity  with  a  task\nincreases,  the  individual’s  perception  of  the  associated\nrisk  is  less  likely  to  match  actual  risk.  A  perceived  reduc‐\ntion   in   risk   can   create   “inattentional   blindness”   and\ninsensitivity to the presence of hazards.\nQ.5 Error  Precursors.  Error  precursors  are  situations  when\nthe  demands  of  the  task  and  the  environment  it  is  performed\nin exceed the capabilities of the individual(s) or the limitations\nof  human  nature.  Error  precursors  can  also  be  unfavorable\nconditions  that  increase  the  probability  for  error  during  a\nspecific  action.  Error  precursors  can  be  grouped  into  four\nbroad categories.\n(1)Task demands — when specific mental, physical, or team\nrequirements to perform a task either exceed the capabil‐\nities   or   challenge   the   limitations   of   the   individual\nassigned to the task.\n(2)Work  environment  —  when  general  influences  of  the\nworkplace,  organizational,  and  cultural  conditions  affect\nindividual performance.\n(3)Individual  capabilities  —  when  an  individual’s  unique\nmental,  physical,  and  emotional  characteristics  do  not\nmatch the demands of the specific task.\n(4)Human  nature  —  when  traits,  dispositions,  and  limita‐\ntions  common  to  all  persons  incline  an  individual  to  err\nunder unfavorable conditions.\nTable  Q.5  provides  a  list  of  specific  examples  for  each  cate‐\ngory.\nWhen  error  precursors  are  identified  and  addressed  then\nthe likelihood of human error is reduced.\nQ.6  Human Performance Tools.\nQ.6.1  Application.  Human performance tools reduce the like‐\nlihood  of  error  when  applied  to  error  precursors.  Consistent\nuse  of  human  performance  tools  by  an  organization  will  facili‐\ntate the incorporation of best practice work. The following are\nsome  human  performance  tools.  See  Table  Q.5  for  a  list  of\nthese tools.\nCopyright National Fire Protection Association \nProvided by IHS Markit under license with NFPA\n\n\nINFORMATIVE ANNEX Q\n70E–94\nShaded text = Revisions.

Incorporating  a  job  site  review\ninto  job  planning  facilitates  the  identification  of  hazards  and\npotential   barriers   and   delays.   A   job   site   review   can   be\nperformed any time prior or during work.\nQ.6.4 Post-Job  Review  Tool.  A  post-job  review  is  a  positive\nopportunity  to  capture  feedback  and  lessons  learned  from  the\njob that can be applied to future jobs. The use of or lack of use\nof  human  performance  tools  should  be  incorporated  into  the\nreview.\nThe  pre-job  briefing  and  the  post-job  review  are  effective\ncommunication tools.\nTable Q.5  Error Precursor Identification and Human Performance Tool Selection (see Q.5 and Q.6.1)\nError Precursors\nOptimal\nTool(s)Human Performance Tools\nTask Demands1 Pre-job briefing\nTime pressure (in a hurry)Identify hazards, assess risk and select and implement risk \ncontrols from a hierarchy of methodsHigh workload (memory requirements)\nSimultaneous or multiple tasks\n2 Job site review\nRepetitive actions or monotonyIncreased situational awareness\nCritical steps or irreversible acts\n3 Post-job review\nInterpretation requirementsIdentify ways to improve and best practices\nUnclear goals, roles, or responsibilitiesPeer check\nLack of or unclear standards\n4 Procedure use and adherence\nWork Environment\nStep-by-step procedure read, outcome understood\nDistractions/interruptionsCircle the task to be performed, check off each task as it is \ncompletedChanges/departures from routine\nConfusing displays or controls\n5 Self-check with verbalization\nWorkarounds/out of service instrumentationStop, Think, Act, Review (STAR)\nObscure electrical supplies or configurationsVerbalize intent before, during, and after each task\nUnexpected equipment conditions\n6 Three-way communication\nLack of alternative indicationDirectives are repeated by receiver back to sender; receiver \nis acknowledged by senderPersonality conflicts\nIndividual Capabilities\nUse of the phonetic alphabet for clarity\nUnfamiliar with, or first time performing task\n7 Stop when unsure\nLack of knowledge (faulty mental model)Stop and obtain further direction when unable to follow a \nprocedure or process step or if something unexpected \noccurs\nNew technique not used before\nImprecise communication habits\nLack of proficiency or experienceMaintain a questioning attitude\nIndistinct problem-solving skills\n8 Flagging and blocking\nUnsafe attitudes for critical taskIdentify (flag) equipment and controls that will be operated\nInappropriate valuesPrevent access (block) equipment and controls that should \nnot be operated\nHuman Nature\nStress (limits attention)\nHabit patterns\nAssumptions\nComplacency/overconfidence\nMind-set\nInaccurate risk perception\nMental shortcuts (biases) or limited short-term memory\nNotes:\nThis table may be utilized when identifying workplace hazards.

Adhering to a writ‐\nten step-by-step sequential procedure is a human performance\ntool.  The  worker  should  proactively  read  and  understand  the\npurpose,  scope,  and  intent  of  all  actions  as  written  and  in  the\nsequence specified.\nAn accurate and current account of progress should be kept\nby marking each step in the procedure as it is completed. This\nensures that if the procedure is interrupted before all the steps\nare completed, the job site or activity can be left in a safe state\nand the procedure can be resumed at the point it was interrup‐\nted.\nIf  the  procedure  cannot  be  used  as  written,  or  if  the  expec‐\nted  result  cannot  be  accurately  predicted,  then  the  activity\nshould be stopped and the issues resolved before continuing.\nAn  example  of  adhering  to  a  written  step-by-step  sequential\nprocedure  is  a  switching  sequence,  wherein  the  sequential\norder of operation of electrical distribution equipment is iden‐\ntified  and  documented  for  the  purposes  of  de-energizing  and\nre-energizing.\nQ.6.6 Self-Check  with  Verbalization  Tool.  The  self-check  with\nverbalization tool is also known by the acronym STAR — Stop,\nThink, Act, and Review. Before, during, and after performing a\ntask  that  cannot  be  reversed,  the  worker  should  stop,  think,\nand openly verbalize their actions. Verbalizing permits the indi‐\nvidual’s brain to slow down to their body speed. It has the effect\nof  keeping  the  individual  focused,  thus  enabling  them  to  act\nand then review their actions.\nExample:  A  worker  has  one  more  routine  task  to  complete\nbefore  the  end  of  shift  —  to  approach  a  group  of  motor\ncontrol  panels  and  close  a  circuit  breaker  in  one  of  those\npanels. The error precursors are task demands (in a hurry) and\nhuman  nature  (complacency).  If  the  worker  verbalizes  each\nstep in the task and the expected outcome of each step, he or\nshe  is  less  likely  to  operate  the  wrong  circuit  breaker  and  will\nbe  prepared  in  the  event  that  the  outcome  of  an  action  does\nnot match the expectation. For example, the worker self checks\nand verbalizes:\n(1)I am at Panel 12 Bravo (12B).\n(2)I am about to close Circuit Breaker 4 Bravo (4B).\n(3)The pump motor heater indicator light will engage bright\nred on Panel 10 Bravo (10B).\n(4)The pump motor should not start.\n(5)If the pump motor starts then I will open Circuit Breaker\n4 Bravo.\n(6)I am now closing Circuit Breaker 4 Bravo.\nQ.6.7 Three-Way      Communication      Tool.  The      three-way\ncommunication  tool  facilitates  a  mutual  understanding  of  the\nmessage  between  the  sender  and  receiver.  After  a  directive  or\nstatement  is  made  by  the  sender,  it  is  repeated  by  the  receiver\nto confirm the accuracy of the message.\nWhen the message includes the use of letters, then whenever\npossible   the   letters   should   be   communicated   using   the\nphonetic alphabet.\nExample:  A  sender  issues  a  directive  over  a  radio  communi‐\ncation  device:  “Close  circuit  breaker  4  Bravo.”  The  receiver\nrepeats  the  message:  “I  understand,  close  circuit  breaker  4\nBravo.”  The  sender  validates  that  the  proper  response  was\nunderstood: “That is correct” or “Affirmative.”\nQ.6.8 Stop  When  Unsure  Tool.  When  a  worker  is  unable  to\nfollow  a  procedure  or  process  step,  if  something  unexpected\noccurs or if the worker has a “gut feeling” that something is not\nright,  then  the  worker  should  stop  and  obtain  further  direc‐\ntion.  The  “stop  when  unsure”  tool  requires  that  the  worker\nmaintain a questioning attitude at all times.\nPhrases  such  as  “I  think”  or  “I’m  pretty  sure,”  whether\nverbalized  or  not,  indicate  that  the  worker  is  in  knowledge-\nbased  mode  and  needs  to  transition  to  rule-based  mode.  This\ntransition should be communicated to co-workers.\nQ.6.9 Flagging and Blocking Tools [see 130.7(E)].  Flagging is a\nmethod  to  ensure  the  correct  component  is  manipulated  or\nworked on at the required time under the required conditions.\nA flag could be a marker, label, or device.\nIt should be used when an error-likely situation or condition\nis present, such as one of the following:\n(1)Similar or “look-alike” equipment\n(2)Work on multiple components\n(3)Frequent operations performed in a short period of time\n(4)Interruption of process critical equipment\nBlocking  is  a  method  of  physically  preventing  access  to  an\narea or equipment controls.\nHinged  covers  on  control  buttons  or  switches,  barricades,\nfences or other physical barriers, whether temporary or perma‐\nnent, are examples of blocking tools.\nBlocking can be used in conjunction with flagging.\nQ.7  Human Performance Warning Flags.\nQ.7.1  General.  There  are  common  process,  organizational,\nsupervisory,  and  worker  performance  weaknesses  that  serve  as\nhuman performance warning flags. These warning flags should\nbe identified by the organization and action should be taken to\naddress the root cause.\nQ.7.2 Program   or   Process.  The   following   are   program   or\nprocess human performance warning flags:\n(1)Risk management processes are over-relied on, instead of\npersonal ownership and accountability for managing risk.\n(2)Risk  management  processes  are  inefficient  or  cumber‐\nsome (“more” is often not better).\nQ.7.3 Organizational  Performance.  The  following  are  organi‐\nzational human performance warning flags:\n(1)Personnel  in  the  organization  tend  to  engage  in  consen‐\nsus  or  group  thinking,  without  encouraging  counterview\npoints.\n(2)Personnel   overly   defer   to   managers   and   perceived\nexperts.\n(3)Activities with high risk are not assigned clear owners.\n(4)Past  success  without  adverse  outcomes  becomes  the  basis\nfor continuing current practices.\n(5)The   organization   assumes   that   risk   management   is\nhealthy  because  a  program  or  process  was  established\n(i.e., complacency exists).\nQ.7.4 Supervisory  Performance.  The  following  are  supervi‐\nsory human performance warning flags:\n(1)Delegation  is  lacking,  with  a  few  individuals  relied  on  to\nmake major decisions.\nCopyright National Fire Protection Association \nProvided by IHS Markit under license with NFPA\n\n\nINFORMATIVE ANNEX Q\n70E–96\nShaded text = Revisions. Δ = Text deletions and figure/table revisions.    • = Section deletions. N = New material.\n(2)Supervision  is  physically  or  mentally  separated  from  the\njob  site  and  is  insufficiently  aware  of  current  conditions\nand attitudes.\n(3)Personnel  in  the  organization  do  not  understand  how\nrisk is perceived and managed at the worker level.\n(4)Past  success  without  adverse  outcomes  becomes  the  basis\nfor continuing current practices.\n(5)Performance  indicators  are  used  to  justify  existing  risk\nmanagement strategies.\nQ.7.5 Worker Performance.  The following are worker human\nperformance warning flags:\n(1)Individuals  or  groups  exhibit  self-imposed  production\npressure.\n(2)Work activities are considered routine.\n(3)Individuals  are  quick  to  make  risky  judgments  without\ntaking the time to fully understand the situation.\n(4)Past  success  without  adverse  outcomes  becomes  the  basis\nfor continuing current practices.\n(5)Personnel  take  pride  in  their  ability  to  work  through  or\nwith levels of risk that could have been mitigated or elimi‐\nnated.\n(6)Risk  is  not  communicated  effectively  up  the  company.\nIndividuals  assume  that  the  next  level  of  supervision\nknows  or  understands  the  risk  involved  or  that  there  are\ninsufficient resources to manage the risk.\n(7)Problem reporting is not transparent. Individuals are not\nwilling to report high-risk conditions.\nQ.8  Workplace Culture.\nQ.8.1  General.  The reduction or elimination of electrical inci‐\ndents requires that all members at the workplace cultivate and\nconsistently  exhibit  a  culture  that  supports  the  use  of  human\nperformance  tools  and  principles.  Workers,  supervisors,  and\nmanagers  must  all  work  together  to  implement  strong  human\nperformance practices.\nQ.8.2  Workers.  The  safe  performance  of  activities  by  workers\nis  a  product  of  mental  processes  influenced  by  factors  related\nto  the  work  environment,  the  task  demands,  and  the  capabili‐\nties  of  the  worker.  All  need  to  take  responsibility  for  their\nactions and strive to improve themselves, the task at hand, and\nthe  work  environment.  Five  general  practices  that  should  be\nconsistently demonstrated by workers include the following:\n(1)Communication to support a consistent understanding\n(2)Anticipation of error-likely situations and conditions\n(3)Desire to improve personal capabilities\n(4)Reports on all incidents (including “near-miss” incidents)\n(5)A  commitment  to  utilize  human  performance  tools  and\nprinciples\nQ.8.3 Supervisors    and    Managers.  Through    their    actions,\nsupervisors  focus  worker  and  team  efforts  in  order  to  accom‐\nplish  a  task.  To  be  effective,  supervisors  must  understand  what\ninfluences  worker  performance.  Supervisors  promote  positive\noutcomes   into   the   workplace   environment   to   encourage\ndesired  performance  and  results.  Supervisors  must  demon‐\nstrate a passion for identifying and preventing human perform‐\nance  errors.  They  influence  both  individual  and  company\nperformance in order to achieve high levels of workplace elec‐\ntrical  safety.  Five  general  practices  that  should  be  consistently\ndemonstrated by supervisors include the following:\n(1)Promote open communication\n(2)Encourage  teamwork  to  eliminate  error-likely  situations\nand conditions\n(3)Seek out and eliminate broader company weaknesses that\nmay create opportunity for error\n(4)Reinforce desired workplace culture\n(5)Recognize  the  value  in  preventing  errors,  reporting  of\nnear-miss   incidents,   and   the   utilization   of   human\nperformance tools and principles\nQ.8.4 The Organization.  It is important that an organization’s\nprocedures,  processes,  and  values  recognize  and  accept  that\npeople  make  mistakes.  The  policies  and  goals  of  an  organiza‐\ntion   influence   worker   and   supervisor   performance.   Five\ngeneral  practices  that  should  be  consistently  demonstrated  by\nan organization include the following:\n(1)Promote open communication\n(2)Foster  a  culture  that  values  error  prevention  and  the  use\nof human performance tools\n(3)Identify  and  prevent  the  formation  of  error-likely  situa‐\ntions and conditions\n(4)Support  continuous  improvement  and  learning  across\nthe entire organization\n(5)Establish   a   blame-free   culture   that   supports   incident\nreporting  and  proactively  identifies  and  reacts  appropri‐\nately to risk\nCopyright National Fire Protection Association \nProvided by IHS Markit under license with NFPA\n\n\nINFORMATIVE ANNEX R\nShaded text = Revisions.

Capacitors have the ability to store electrical\nenergy  after  the  source  power  has  been  disconnected.  While\nmany systems with capacitors are built with bleed resistors that\nautomatically  discharge  the  stored  energy  within  a  set  time,\nthese  systems  can  sometimes  fail,  leaving  a  thermal,  shock,  arc\nflash,  or  arc  blast  hazard.  Some  capacitor  systems  might  not\nhave  built-in  bleed  resistors.  This  informative  annex  provides\ndetailed guidance on how to properly assess the risk in working\nwith capacitors and implement suitable controls.\nNR.2 Qualification and Training.\nNR.2.1 Qualifications.  Employees who perform work on electri‐\ncal  equipment  with  capacitors  that  exceed  the  energy  thresh‐\nolds   in   360.3   should   be   qualified   persons   as   required   in\nChapter  1  and  should  be  trained  in,  and  familiar  with,  the\nspecific hazards and controls required for safe work.\nNR.2.2 Unqualified   Persons. Unqualified   persons   should   be\ntrained in, and familiar with, any electrical safety-related practi‐\nces necessary for their safety.\nNR.3  Shock Hazard.\nNR.3.1  General.  The  capacitor  shock  hazard  to  a  person  is  an\nimpulse shock with an exponential decay curve. The severity of\nthe shock is related to the amount of energy (joules) delivered\nand  the  time  in  which  the  energy  is  delivered.  Injuries  from\ncapacitor shock include severe reflex action, internal and exter‐\nnal  burns,  and  heart  fibrillation.  Reflex  injury  can  occur  at\nenergy levels as low as 0.25 joules when the capacitor voltage is\nover the skin breakdown threshold (about 400 volts), resulting\nin  a  very  rapid  delivery  of  the  energy.  Reflex  action  can  result\nin  injuries  from  falling,  involuntarily  coming  in  contact  with\nother  hazards,  tearing  muscles,  tendons,  and  ligaments,  or\ndislocation  of  joints.  Internal  burn  injuries  to  nervous  system\nand  other  tissues  can  occur  at  energies  as  low  as  10s  of  joules.\nHeart   fibrillation   can   happen   when   the   voltage   exceeds\n100  volts  and  the  stored  energy  delivered  exceeds  10  joules\nunder  certain  circumstances.  However,  even  without  fibrilla‐\ntion,  a  high-voltage,  high-energy  shock  can  cause  serious  inju‐\nries, either directly or through reflex action, down to as low as\n0.25  joules.  Instances  of  temporary  paralysis,  loss  of  conscious‐\nness,  hearing  damage,  temporary  loss  of  eyesight,  burns,  and\ndislocated joints have been reported. [See Figure R.3.1(a) for a\ncapacitive  shock  circuit  and  Figure  R.3.1(b)  for  a  capacitive\ndischarge curve.]\nNR.3.2 Duration  of  Discharge.  The  duration  of  a  capacitive\ndischarge  shock  is  independent  of  voltage  and  is  generally\nassumed  to  be  three  times  the  time  constant  of  the  shock\ncircuit.  After  three  time  constants,  the  voltage  is  reduced  by\n95 percent, and the energy has been reduced by 99.25 percent.\nThe time constant, τ, is equal to body shock pathway resistance\ntimes capacitance, as follows:\nNR.3.3 Current  Delivered.  The  current  delivered  by  the  shock\nis independent of capacitance and is proportional to the initial\npeak voltage and inversely proportional to shock pathway resist‐\n \n[R.3.2]N\nance. Assuming that all of the stored energy is delivered in 3τ,\nthe rms equivalent current can be expressed as follows:\nI\nV\nR\nrms\np\n=\n6\nwhere:\nI\nrms\n=\nrms current\nV\np\n=\npeak voltage\nR\n=pathway resistance\nNR.3.4 Shock  Pathway.  The  shock  pathway  resistance  depends\non  skin  resistance,  entry  and  exit  locations,  and  internal  body\nresistance. The severity of a capacitor discharge shock depends\non the time of delivery (quickly or slowly) and the energy deliv‐\nered.  A  capacitor  disconnected  from  a  live  voltage  source  has\nonly  a  finite  amount  of  energy  and  can  deliver  that  energy\neither  quickly  or  slowly,  depending  on  specific  shock  pathway\nresistance.  As  shock  pathway  resistance  increases,  the  current\nlowers  but  the  time  to  discharge  also  takes  longer,  and  vice\nversa.  Below  400  volts,  skin  breakdown  is  less  likely  and  skin\nresistance  (over  10,000  ohms  for  intact  skin)  will  significantly\nreduce the shock current and extend discharge time.

N = New material.\ntured, broken, or very wet skin, the contact resistance is 0 ohms\nto 100 ohms.\nNR.3.5 Response  to  Shock  Levels.  For  a  given  stored  energy,\nthere is a difference in response to whether it is a high-voltage,\nlow-capacitance   shock,   or   a   low-voltage,   high-capacitance\nshock. At high voltage and low capacitance, a hazardous shock\nwill  fully  discharge  nearly  instantaneously  (in  microseconds)\nand could miss the vulnerable part of the heart cycle. However,\nthe  full  energy  is  delivered  to  the  person  and  there  could  be\nnerve  or  other  tissue  damage.  At  low  voltage  and  high  capaci‐\ntance,  the  total  discharge  time  can  extend  several  seconds\n(multiple  heart  beats),  behaving  more  like  a  dc  shock.  Both\nscenarios  remain  highly  hazardous  as  fibrillation  could  still\noccur.\nInformational  Note:  For  more  information  on  impulse  shock\nhazards,  see  IEC  TS  60479-2,  Effects  of  Current  on  Humans  and\nLivestock, Part 2, Special Aspects.\nNR.3.6 Reflex  Hazard.  Even  when  fibrillation  does  not  occur,\nthere remains the potential for serious bodily injury, especially\nabove  400  volts.  The  reflex  action  to  an  impulse  shock  can  be\nsevere,  causing  persons  to  fall  off  of  elevated  platforms  or\nladders, knock a body part into nearby objects, or in some cases\ncause  severe  muscle  clenching,  temporary  paralysis,  or  disloca‐\nted  joints.  This  reflex  hazard  extends  to  lower  energies  even\nwhere  fibrillation  is  unlikely.  The  lower  threshold  for  hazard‐\nous reflex shocks is 0.25 joules for over 400 volts.\nNR.3.7 Shock   Hazard   Thresholds.  Capacitors   connected   to\nconductors  or  circuit  parts  operating  at  voltages  equal  to  or\ngreater than 100 volts and containing a stored energy equal to\nor greater than 10 joules present a significant risk of shock and\nfibrillation.  Below  10  joules,  a  significant  risk  of  reflex  action\nleading to injury could exist in the following situations:\n(1)100  volts–400  volts:  if  the  stored  energy  is  greater  than\n1 joule\n(2)>400 volts: if the stored energy is greater than 0.25 joules\nNR.4 Short-Circuit  Hazard.  Capacitors  have  the  unique  ability\nto  discharge  very  rapidly  in  a  shorted  condition  due  to  their\nlow  internal  impedance.  In  ac  power  systems,  faults  typically\noccur  on  the  order  of  milliseconds  and  are  limited  by  trans‐\nformer  impedances.  Battery  faults  take  seconds  or  minutes  to\ndischarge. In contrast, capacitors have very little internal impe‐\ndance  and  can  fully  discharge  in  microseconds,  with  very  high\ndischarge  current.  This  current  can  cause  heating  of  metals,\narc  flash  injury,  and  arc  blast  injury,  dependent  on  the  stored\nenergy  in  the  capacitor.  The  shock  injuries,  including  reflex\nand fibrillation, are discussed in R.3.7. Additional hazards that\ncan  result  from  capacitor  energy  include  those  discussed  in\nR.4.1 through R.4.3.\nNR.4.1 Thermal Hazard.  At around 100 joules, a short through\na metal object in contact with the worker, such as a ring or tool,\ncan  cause  rapid  heating  and  burns  to  the  skin.  Above  1  kJ,\nthere can be substantial heating of metal, arcing, and magnetic\nforces  causing  mechanical  deformation.  Above  10  kJ,  there  is\nmassive   conductor   melting,   massive   magnetic/mechanical\nmotion, and an arc blast hazard.\nwhere:\nV = voltage\nt = time\nVp = peak voltage\nτ = time constant\nR = resistance\nC = capacitance\n0τ\n0%\n50%\nDischarge: \nV (t ) = V\np\n \n. e \nTime constant: τ = RC\n2τ3τ4τ5τ\n<5% after 3 τ\n100%\nτ\n–t\n/\nFIGURE  R.3.1(b)     Typical Exponential Discharge Characteristic of a Capacitor Through a\nResistor.\nCopyright National Fire Protection Association \nProvided by IHS Markit under license with NFPA\n\n\nINFORMATIVE ANNEX R\nShaded text = Revisions.

At  approximately  120  kJ,  there  exists\nsufficient  stored  energy  to  create  an  arc  flash  hazard  (greater\nthan  1.2  cal/cm\n2\n  at  a  working  distance  of  18  in.).  This  is  a\nconservative lower bound that assumes all of the stored energy\nhas  been  converted  to  radiant  heat.  The  threshold  of  120  kJ\ncould  be  lower  for  a  capacitor  in  a  box.  There  could  be  an\nadditional contribution to the arc flash energy from an ac or dc\nsource connected to the capacitor or capacitor bank.\nNR.4.3 Arc  Blast  Hazard.  Capacitors  can  have  a  significant  arc\nblast hazard due to the very high short-circuit current involved.\nThe  effects  of  the  acoustic  shock  wave  can  rupture  eardrums\nand  collapse  lungs.  While  hearing  protection  should  be  used\nabove  100  joules  to  mitigate  against  hearing  damage,  there  is\nno  PPE  for  protection  against  lung  collapse,  which  becomes  a\nhazard above 122 kJ.\nNR.5  Internal Rupture.\nNR.5.1 High  Currents.  When  a  capacitor  is  subjected  to  high\ncurrents,  such  as  a  short  circuit  condition,  internal  stresses\ncould result in violent rupture of the capacitor enclosure.\nNR.5.2  Internal Failure.  When capacitors are used to store large\namounts  of  energy,  internal  failure  of  one  capacitor  in  a  bank\ncould  result  in  the  rupture  and  explosion  of  the  failed  capaci‐\ntors  when  all  other  capacitors  in  the  bank  discharge  into  the\nfault.  Fuses  or  inductive  elements  are  often  used  to  limit  the\nfault  current  from  a  capacitor  bank  into  a  faulted  individual\ncapacitor. Improperly sized fuses or inductive elements for this\napplication could explode.\nNR.5.3 Fire  Hazard.  Rupture  of  a  capacitor  can  create  a  fire\nhazard  from  ignition  of  the  dielectric  fluids.  Dielectric  fluids\ncan release toxic gases when decomposed by fire or the heat of\nan electric arc.\nNR.6  Performing a Risk Assessment for Capacitors.\nNR.6.1 Annex  F.  The  risk  assessment  process  for  capacitors  can\nfollow  the  overall  risk  management  process  found  in  Annex  F.\nThis risk assessment should be coordinated with the shock risk\nassessment of 130.4 and the arc flash risk assessment of 130.5.\nNR.6.2 Exposure  to  Stored  Energy.  Whether  there  is  an  expo‐\nsure  to  capacitor  stored  energy  hazard  should  be  determined.\nAn exposure would exist when a conductor or circuit part that\ncould   potentially   remain   energized   with   hazardous   stored\nenergy  is  not  properly  guarded,  enclosed,  or  insulated.  All\ncircuit  parts  that  are  electrically  connected  to  a  capacitor  or\ncapacitor bank could present this hazard. For example, a power\nfactor correction bank could be in a completely separate enclo‐\nsure;  however,  should  the  bank  remained  charged  for  some\nreason,  the  switchgear  to  which  it  is  connected  could  also\ndeliver the stored energy hazard.\nNR.6.3 Determining  Shock  Hazard.  The  shock  hazard  should\nbe determined using both the voltage and stored energy of the\ncapacitor. A high-voltage capacitor is not a shock hazard below\nthe  energy  threshold  of  0.25  joules.  Use  the  shock  risk  assess‐\nment  process  of  130.4  and  the  dc  shock  approach  boundaries\n(for  capacitors  above  100  volts  and  0.25  joules)  and  PPE\nratings.\nNR.6.4 Determining  Total  Stored  Energy.  The  total  capacitor\nstored energy (see R.8) of the system should be determined.\nNR.6.5 Determining  Arc  Flash.  The  arc  flash  hazard  (see  R.9)\nshould  be  determined.  If  stored  energy  is  greater  than  120  kJ,\nthe arc flash incident energy and the arc flash boundary should\nbe  determined  at  the  appropriate  working  distance.  Appropri‐\nate  arc  flash  PPE  should  be  selected  accordingly,  but  workers\nshould always remain out of the arc blast lung protection boun‐\ndary (see R.6.6).\nNR.6.6  Determining Arc Blast Hazard.  The arc blast hazard (see\nR.10)  should  be  determined.  Hearing  protection  should  be\nused  where  the  stored  energy  exceeds  100  joules.  Where  the\nstored  energy  exceeds  10  kJ,  the  hearing  protection  boundary\nshould  be  calculated.  If  stored  energy  is  above  122  kJ,  deter‐\nmine  the  arc  blast  boundary  for  lung  hazards.  A  lung  collapse\nhazard could exist above 122 kJ. DO NOT ENTER THE LUNG\nPROTECTION  BOUNDARY.  There  is  no  PPE  for  lung  protec‐\ntion.\nNR.6.7  Determine the Test and Grounding Method.  (See R.11.)\nNR.6.8  Determining Discharge Time.  If capacitors are equipped\nwith  bleed  resistors,  or  if  using  a  soft  grounding  system,  the\nrequired  discharge  wait  time  should  be  determined  where\napplicable  (see  R.12).  After  the  discharge  time  a  hard  ground\nstick or hard grounding system should be applied.\nNR.6.9  Written Discharge Procedure.  A written discharge proce‐\ndure should be developed that captures all of the steps to place\nthe  equipment  into  an  electrically  safe  work  condition.  Infor‐\nmation about the amount of stored energy available, how long\nto  wait  after  de-energization  before  opening  the  enclosure,\nhow to test for absence of energy, and what to do if there is still\nstored energy present should be included.\nNR.6.10  Labeling.  Labeling  the  equipment  with  a  hazard  warn‐\ning  label  (see  R.15)  should  be  considered  so  that  qualified\npersons are made aware of the potential for stored energy and\nthe  need  for  a  written  discharge  procedure.  The  maximum\nvoltage and stored energy should be included.\nNR.7  Determining the Shock Hazard.\nNR.7.1 Risk  Assessment.  A  shock  risk  assessment  should  be\nperformed  for  capacitors  exceeding  the  thresholds  in  360.3  in\naccordance  with  130.4.  Shock  approach  boundaries  are  based\non  the  peak  voltage  and  the  dc  shock  approach  boundaries  of\nTable  130.4(E)(b).  Appropriately  rated  shock  protection  PPE,\nsuch  as  voltage-rated  gloves  and  dielectric  insulating  sheeting,\nshould  be  selected.  The  dc  ratings  for  rubber  insulated  prod‐\nucts should be used. (See ASTM D120, Standard Specification for\nRubber   Insulating   Gloves,   for   dc   ratings.)   The   restricted\napproach boundary should be used to assist in the selection of\nthe  length  and  voltage  rating  of  the  ground  stick.  Capacitors\nbelow  the  thresholds  defined  in  360.3  are  not  shock  hazards,\nand 130.4 does not apply. This includes capacitors from 0 volts\nto  100  volts  and  less  than  100  joules,  capacitors  100  volts  to\n400  volts  and  less  than  1  joule,  and  capacitors  greater  than\n400 volts and less than 0.25 joules.\nNR.7.2 Shock  PPE.  Shock  protection  PPE  is  required  for  all\nparts  of  the  body  that  enter  the  restricted  approach  boundary\nfor   capacitor   shock   hazards   defined   in   R.7.1.   [See   Table\n130.4(E)(b).]\nNR.8  Determining Capacitor Stored Energy.\nNR.8.1 Capacitor  Stored  Energy.  Determining  capacitor  stored\nenergy  could  require  detailed  examination  of  schematics  or\nmanufacturer’s  information  to  properly  determine  both  the\npeak voltage that will be applied to the capacitors and the total\ncapacitance.

Manufacturer’s  specifications  on  capaci‐\ntance per meter should be consulted.\nNR.8.4  Voltage.  For peak voltage, the voltage applied across the\ncapacitors  that  would  cause  the  maximum  charge  should  be\nused.  For  disconnected  capacitors  in  storage  or  for  disposal,\nthe capacitor rated voltage should be used.\nNR.8.4.1  For  dc  systems,  use  the  maximum  available  terminal\nvoltage that could be applied to the capacitor by the system.\n \n[R.8.2]N\nNR.8.4.2  For  ac  systems,  nominal  system  voltage  is  normally\nexpressed in volts rms (root mean square).

Always check the configuration as\ndesign requirements vary.\nNR.9  Determining the Arc Flash Hazard.\nNR.9.1 Incident  Energy.  The  maximum  theoretical  possible  arc\nflash incident energy can be calculated by assuming that all of\nthe  stored  energy  is  dissipated  as  radiant  energy  in  a  spherical\nexpansion in open air. While this is unlikely, it helps set a lower\nbound  of  stored  energy  below  which  an  arc  flash  hazard  is\nunlikely.\nIE\nEnergy\nArea\nCV\nr\nCV\nr\nJ    cm\nopen  air \n===\n1\n2\n48\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\nππ\n/\nConverting  to  cal/cm2  (1  cal  =  4.184  joules)  we  obtain  the\nfollowing:\nIE\nCV\nr\nE\nr\ncal   cm\nopen  air \n==\n2\n22\n2\n105 152 6..\n/\nwhere:\nIE\n=incident energy\nE\n=energy\nC\n=capacitance\nV\n=voltage\nr\n=radius\n \n[R.8.4.2a]N\n \n[R.9.1a]N\n \n[R.9.1b]N\nCopyright National Fire Protection Association \nProvided by IHS Markit under license with NFPA\n\n\nINFORMATIVE ANNEX R\nShaded text = Revisions.

The arc flash boundary, where IE =\n1.2 cal/cm\n2\n, is then as follows:\nAFBE  cmE  in\nopen  air \n==0 1260 05.().(   .)\nIn a box, we can apply a three times factor over the open-air\nincident energy calculation, as follows:\nIEIE\nboxopen  air\n=   ×3\n \nAFBAFB\nboxopen  air\n=×3\n \nwhere:\nAFB\n=arc flash boundary\nIE\n=incident energy\nThus,  the  minimum  stored  energy  (lower  bound)  required\nto obtain 1.2 cal/cm\n2\n at a working distance of 18 in. is roughly\n44 kJ in a box or 120 kJ in open air. Extreme caution should be\nused  with  the  open-air  calculation,  as  the  arc  flash  boundary\ncan  fall  inside  the  lung  protection  boundary  for  arc  blast.  A\nbetter practice is to always use the box arc flash boundary as a\nminimum approach distance.\nNR.10  Determining the Arc Blast Hazard.\nNR.10.1  Hazard.  The  arc  blast  hazard  is  directly  related  to  the\ninstantaneous  (initial)  short  circuit  current.  Since  capacitors\ncan discharge very rapidly, the shockwave generated by a capac‐\nitor  discharge  can  cause  barotrauma  (overpressure  injury)  to\npersons  in  the  area.  The  most  sensitive  organs  are  the  ears,\nlungs,  and  brain.  When  a  differential  pressure  across  the\neardrums  exceeds  around  20–35  kilopascals  (3–5  psi),  the\neardrum can rupture. At 200 kilopascals (29 psi), lung damage\ncan  occur.  The  following  formulas  are  used  to  estimate  safe\nboundaries  based  on  total  stored  energy,  where  “safe”  is  less\nthan a 1 percent probability of eardrum rupture or lung injury:\nR\nE\near\n=−49 29\n1000\n5 09\n3\n..\nR\nE\nlung\n=−31 32\n1000\n155 45\n3\n..\nwhere:\nR\near\n=eardrum rupture boundary (1 percent probability) in\ncm\nR\nlung\n=\nlung collapse boundary (1 percent probability) in cm\nE\n=capacitor stored energy in joules\nInformational Note: For more information about the derivation\nof  these  formulas,  see  Charles  R.

Porschet, “Safe Distances From a High-Energy Capac‐\nitor Bank for Ear and Lung Protection,” Army Research Laboratory\nReport, ARL-TN-608, July 2014.\n \n[R.9.2a]N\n \n[R.9.2b]N\n \n[R.9.2c]N\n \n[R.10.1a]N\n \n[R.10.1b]N\nNR.10.2 Above 122 kJ.  Above 122 kJ a lung collapse hazard can\nexist.  It  is  not  sufficient  to  wear  arc  flash  PPE,  as  this  will  not\nprotect against lung injury. Remain outside of the lung collapse\nboundary.\nNR.10.3 Above 448 kJ.  Above 448 kJ, the lung protection boun‐\ndary  will  be  greater  than  the  arc  flash  boundary  in  open  air\ncalculated in R.9. A better practice is to always use the box arc\nflash  boundary  as  a  minimum  approach  distance.  (See  Figure\nR.10.3.)\nNR.11  Selecting the Appropriate Test and Grounding Method.\nNR.11.1 Method  Selection.  The  method  to  safely  discharge  or\nverify  discharge  of  a  capacitor  will  vary  depending  on  the\ndegree  of  hazard.  Low-voltage,  low-energy  capacitors  can  be\nverified  de-energized  with  a  properly  rated  test  instrument\nmeeting  the  requirements  of  110.8  and/or  hard  grounded.  At\nhigher  energy  and  voltage,  soft  grounding  through  a  resistor\ncould  be  needed  to  limit  the  discharge  current.  At  very  high\nenergies (>100 kJ), manual testing or grounding can become a\nserious  arc  blast  hazard,  and  remote  metering  and  grounding\nshould be performed.\nNR.11.2 Bleed  Systems.  For  systems  with  permanently  installed\nbleed  systems,  testing  for  absence  of  voltage  after  the  pre‐\nscribed  discharge  time  can  be  performed  instead  of  applying\ngrounds.  Testing  can  also  be  performed  as  a  means  to  verify\nabsence of voltage after an automatically switched bleed system\nhas  grounded  the  system.  In  all  cases,  the  test  device  must  be\nrated for the system. (See Table R.11.9 for the appropriate test\nmethod.)\nNR.11.2.1  Below  1000  volts  and  below  10  kJ,  a  properly  rated,\nhigh-impedance digital voltmeter (DVM) can be used.\nNR.11.2.2  Above  1000  volts  and  below  100  joules,  a  properly\nrated,  high-impedance  digital  voltmeter  (DVM)  can  be  used\nwith an approved attachment for measuring high-voltage dc on\nnon-utility   systems.   On   utility   systems,   a   utility-grade,   dc,\nresistive-type voltmeter must be used with a live-line tool.\nNR.11.2.3  Above 1000 volts and between 100 joules and 100 kJ, a\nutility-grade, dc, resistive-type voltmeter can be used with a live-\nline tool.\nNR.11.2.4  Above  100  kJ,  engineered  method  can  be  used  only\nfor verifying absence of voltage.\nNR.11.3 Hard  Grounding.  Hard  grounding  is  the  practice  of\nshorting   a   capacitor   from   terminal   to   terminal   and   then\ndirectly  to  ground.  Since  the  resistance  is  typically  <0.1  ohm,\nthe  discharge  time  is  rapid  and  the  discharge  current  can  be\nhigh. An intense spark and a loud noise can happen at higher\nenergies.  Above  100  joules  there  is  a  hearing  damage  hazard.\nThe  voltage  reversal  associated  with  using  a  hard  ground  can\nput  excessive  voltage  stress  on  the  capacitor.  Since  this  is  an\nequipment issue, check with the manufacturer for their recom‐\nmendations.\nCopyright National Fire Protection Association \nProvided by IHS Markit under license with NFPA\n\n\nINFORMATIVE ANNEX R\n70E–102\nShaded text = Revisions. Δ = Text deletions and figure/table revisions.    • = Section deletions. N = New material.\nNR.11.4 Soft   Grounding.  Soft   grounding   is   the   practice   of\ndischarging a capacitor through a resistor rated for the power.\nThe resistor raises the time constant (τ = RC) and reduces the\npeak discharge current (I = V/R) to safer levels. Soft discharge\nis necessary above 1000 joules.\nNR.11.5 End of Discharge Time.  At the conclusion of the speci‐\nfied  discharge  time,  there  is  still  voltage  on  the  capacitors.  A\nproperly matched resistor and capacitor will reduce the voltage\nto less than 50 volts and the energy to less than 5 joules. At this\npoint hard grounding is applied to fully short the capacitors to\nground.\nNR.11.6 Resistor  Connection  Point.  Sometimes  the  grounding\nresistor is attached directly to the grounding stick. Other times,\nthere  are  two  separate  grounding  points  built  into  the  equip‐\nment  itself.  The  grounding  point  labeled  “High-Z”  is  the  soft\ngrounding  point,  where  “High-Z”  stands  for  high  impedance.\nThe  grounding  point  labeled  “Low-Z”  is  the  hard  grounding\npoint, directly to ground. In this case the same ground stick is\napplied,  first  to  the  High-Z  point,  then  to  the  Low-Z  ground\npoint. See Figure R.11.9.\nNR.11.7 Lung   Protection   Boundary.  The   grounding   method\nshould  keep  all  personnel  clear  of  the  lung  protection  boun‐\ndary.  For  this  reason,  above  100  kJ,  remote  soft  grounding  is\nnecessary.\nNR.11.8 Ground   Sticks.  All   ground   sticks   should   meet   the\nconstruction and periodic inspection requirements of R.16.\nNR.11.9 Use  of  Table  for  Method  Selection.

Other   considerations   are   as\nfollows:\n(1)Charge   transfer:   Grounding   capacitors   in   series   may\ntransfer charge between capacitors rather than discharge\nthe  stored  energy.  Special  precaution  should  be  taken  in\nselecting  the  tools  and  sequence  necessary  to  discharge\ncapacitors  connected  in  series.  Improper  grounding  can\nresult in moving charge around and not fully discharging\nto  ground.  Capacitor  cases  are  not  always  grounded  and\nshould  be  considered  charged  unless  otherwise  deter‐\nmined.\n(2)Dielectric absorption: Not all the energy in a capacitor is\ndissipated  when  it  is  short-circuited  for  a  short  time.\nAlthough   the   charge   on   the   plates   may   be   initially\nremoved, dielectric polarization can cause charge to accu‐\nmulate  after  the  ground  is  removed.  A  voltage  recharge\nof  up  to  10  percent  can  occur  a  few  minutes  after  the\ngrounding or shorting device has been removed. This can\noccur in capacitors with liquid dielectrics, such as an elec‐\ntrolytic  capacitor,  and  in  capacitors  with  solid  dielectrics,\nsuch as polyethylene film capacitors.\n(3)High-voltage  capacitors  can  build  a  charge  in  the  pres‐\nence of high electric fields.\n(4)A momentary hazardous voltage can exist at the moment\nof  contact  across  the  inductance  of  a  few  feet  of  the\ngrounding  cable  of  a  ground  stick  at  the  moment  of\ncontact  with  a  charged  capacitor.  This  is  why  a  worker\nshould   never   hold   the   grounding   cable   during   a\ndischarge event.\nNR.12  Determining the Capacitor Discharge Time.\nNR.12.1 Discharge Time.  The discharge time, T\nd\n, of a capacitor\nis the time it takes to reduce to less than 100 volts. It is related\nto the time constant, τ. The discharge resistance can be perma‐\nnently  installed  on  the  capacitors  (e.g.,  a  bleeder  resistor),\nautomatically  switched  in  after  power  shutoff  (e.g.,  a  resistor\ndump bank), or applied through a soft grounding stick.\nNR.12.2 Voltages   1000   Volts   and   Less.  For   voltages   up   to\n1000 volts, it is sufficient to wait three times the time constant,\nor  one  minute,  whichever  is  greater.  That  is  because  after  3τ,\nthe residual voltage is less than 5 percent of the initial voltage.\nR\nbody\nV\nC\nHard grounding: An insulating stick with a\ngrounding tip is used to discharge a\ncapacitor between its two terminals and \nthen to ground.\nSoft grounding 1: An insulating stick with\na mounted resistor is used to perform a\ncontrolled discharge of the capacitor\ncharge using the High-Z tip first.

Where   a   conductor\ncircuit  part  is  operating  at  or  above  100  volts  and  10  joules,  a\nwritten  discharge  procedure  (such  as  a  complex  LOTO  proce‐\ndure) should be used to document the necessary steps to place\nthe equipment in an electrically safe work condition. The writ‐\nten  discharge  procedure  should  incorporate  the  results  of  the\nrisk assessment performed in R.6 and specify the following at a\nminimum:\n(1)Voltage in volts\n \n[R.12.3a]N\n \n[R.12.3b]N\n(2)Energy in joules\n(3)Specific  steps  to  safely  discharge  the  capacitor  or  verify\nthat it is discharged\n(4)Specific tool(s)(e.g., ground stick) or engineering system\nto discharge the capacitors, if necessary\n(5)Specific   test   instruments   (e.g.,   DVM)   or   engineered\nsystems used to verify a de-energized state\nNR.13.2 Electrically Safe Work Condition.  In order to place the\nequipment with stored hazardous energy in an electrically safe\nwork  condition,  a  qualified  person  should  follow  the  steps  in\n120.5  as  well  as  the  specific  sequence  outlined  in  the  written\ndischarge procedure. The process to remove stored energy in a\ncapacitor is a part of the overall process to establish an electri‐\ncal  safe  work  condition  in  120.5.  These  would  then  be  as\nfollows:\n(1)Review  the  scope  of  work  and  the  written  discharge\nprocedure.  Determine  all  safe  approach  boundaries  and\nnecessary PPE and tools for the task.\n(2)Perform  a  job  briefing  with  the  personnel  involved  and\nnotify  affected  persons  that  the  equipment  will  be  de-\nenergized.\n(3)After  properly  interrupting  the  supply  current,  open  the\ndisconnecting   device(s)   for   each   source   feeding   the\nequipment.\n(4)Wherever  possible,  visually  verify  that  all  blades  of  the\ndisconnecting devices are fully open or that drawout-type\ncircuit  breakers  are  withdrawn  to  the  fully  disconnected\nposition.\n(5)Apply lockout/tagout devices in accordance with a docu‐\nmented  and  established  policy,  or  use  plug  control  on\nsmaller equipment.\n< 1000 joules\n1000 joules–100 kJ\nDischarge stored\nenergy\nVerify discharge\n(test or ground)\nKeep discharged\n(short and/or\nground)\nBleed resistors\nor automatic\ndischarge\ninstalled?\nBleed resistors\nor automatic\ndischarge\ninstalled?\nHard groundSoft ground\nNONO\nYES\nYES\nOR\n> 100 kJ\nRemote test\nand\nground\nWait the\ndischarge\ntime\nTestSoft ground\nHard ground\nShort out\nterminals or leave\nground applied\nShort out\nterminals or leave\nground applied\nShort out\nterminals or leave\nground applied\nManual test\nand\nground\nWait the\ndischarge\ntime\nOR\nTestHard ground\nFIGURE  R.11.9(b)     Flowchart of Capacitor Test and Grounding Methods to Establish Safe Discharge\nCopyright National Fire Protection Association \nProvided by IHS Markit under license with NFPA\n\n\nINFORMATIVE ANNEX R\nShaded text = Revisions.

For   series   capacitors   these   shorting   wires\nshould  be  attached  across  each  individual  capacitor  and  to\ncase. For single capacitors or for a parallel capacitor bank, the\ngrounding  device  should  be  permitted  to  be  left  hanging  on\nthe  capacitor  terminal  during  the  work  (e.g.,  a  ground  stick/\nhook).\nNR.14  Storage and Disposal.\nNR.14.1 Residual  Charge.  Any  residual  charge  from  capacitors\nshould  be  removed  by  discharging  the  terminals  before  servic‐\ning or removal.\nNR.14.2  Stored Capacitors.  All uninstalled capacitors capable of\nstoring energy exceeding the thresholds of 360.3 at their rated\nvoltage should be short-circuited with a conductor of appropri‐\nate size.\nNR.14.3 Capacitors   Without   Shorting   Wire.  When   an   unin‐\nstalled capacitor is discovered without a shorting wire attached\nto the terminals, it should be treated as energized and charged\nto its full rated voltage until determined otherwise. A qualified\nperson should be contacted to determine the appropriate steps\nto safely discharge the capacitor.\nNR.14.4 Change   in   Initial   Capacitance.  Large,   high-voltage\ncapacitors  are  often  formed  of  a  network  of  smaller  capacitor\nelements connected inside a case. When such a capacitor devel‐\nops  an  internal  open  circuit,  it  can  retain  a  substantial  charge\ninternally   even   though   the   external   terminals   are   short-\ncircuited.  Such  a  capacitor  can  be  hazardous  to  transport\nbecause   the   damaged   internal   wiring   can   reconnect   and\ndischarge the capacitor through the short-circuiting wires. Any\ncapacitor that shows a significant change in capacitance after a\nfault can have this problem. Action should be taken to reduce\nthe risk associated with this hazard when it is discovered.\nNR.15  Capacitor Hazard Labeling.\nNR.15.1  Labeling.  Electrical  equipment  operating  at  or  above\n100  volts  and  10  joules  should  be  field  marked  with  a  label\ncontaining all the following information:\n(1)A   warning   about   the   potential   for   capacitive   stored\nenergy, with the word “WARNING” on an orange colored\nbackground\n(2)Stored energy in joules and the maximum voltage for that\nstored energy\n(3)The  required  wait  time  before  opening  the  enclosure\n(the  wait  time  needs  to  be  greater  than  the  discharge\ntime)\n(4)Date of the stored energy hazard analysis\n(5)An  instruction  that  a  qualified  person  is  necessary  and\nthat they should use a written discharge procedure\nNR.15.2  Labeling  should  conform  to  the  requirements  of  ANSI\nZ535.4, Product Safety Signs and Labels.\nNR.16  Ground Sticks.\nNR.16.1 Use  of  Ground  Sticks.  Ground  sticks  should  be  provi‐\nded for qualified persons to safely discharge any residual stored\nenergy contained in capacitor(s). The ground sticks should be\ndesigned,  constructed,  installed,  and  periodically  inspected  so\nthat  the  full  energy  of  a  capacitor(s)  can  be  safely  discharged.\nSee Table R.11.9 for selection guidance.\nNR.16.2  Construction.  Design and construction are as follows:\n(1)Ground  stick  rod:  When  built  of  fiber  reinforced  plastic\n(FRP), the rod in the ground stick assembly should meet\nASTM  F711,  Standard  Specification  for  Fiberglass-Reinforced\nPlastic (FRP) Rod and Tube Used in Live Line Tools, specifica‐\ntions.  Other  insulating  materials  may  be  used  provided\nthey  are  of  acceptable  insulation  and  durability  for  the\napplication.  The  stick  should  be  long  enough  to  be\nhandled effectively and also to keep a person’s hands out\nof the restricted approach boundary. This should include\na  non-moveable  hand  stop  to  remind  the  worker  during\nuse where to hold the ground stick.\n(2)Ground   stick   tip:   The   ground   stick   connection   to\ndischarge  points  may  be  chain  links,  bare  conductor,  or\nsolid  copper  bar  in  various  geometries.  The  selection  of\nthe  grounding  tip  should  match  the  requirements  of  the\nintended application and ensure that all necessary circuit\nparts are fully discharged and grounded at the same time\nin order to avoid charge transfer. The grounding tips can\nbe designed to remain applied (e.g., a hook) in order to\nsafely   prevent   recharging   from   dielectric   absorption.\nAlternatively,  shorting  straps  may  be  applied  while  the\ngrounding sticks are applied. Discharge points should be\nclearly  marked  and  caution  should  be  used  to  prevent\ntransferring  charge  to  other  capacitors  or  reversing  the\ncharge on affected capacitors.\n(3)Ground stick resistor: Soft grounding should be provided\nwhere  stored  energy  exceeds  1000  joules.  The  resistor\nused to soft ground a capacitor(s) should be fully rated to\nhandle power, voltage, and current. An engineering safety\nmargin  would  be  to  calculate  peak  power,  voltage  and\ncurrent,  and  double  the  resistor  rating  for  each  parame‐\nter. The resistor should be able to discharge the capacitor\nbank  to  less  than  50  volts  and  less  than  5  joules  in  less\nthan 1 minute (less than1000 volts) or less than 5 minutes\n(greater  than  1000  volts).  Ideally,  the  current  should  be\nlimited  to  500  amperes  peak  in  order  to  reduce  the\nmagnetic force on the ground stick and its cable. This can\nrequire a discharge time longer than 5 minutes. Note that\nsoft  grounding  is  always  followed  by  hard  grounding  to\ncomplete the discharge.\n(4)Ground  stick  cable:  The  cable  should  be  grounding  or\nwelding  cable,  flexible  rope  lay,  soft  drawn  copper.  The\nindividual  strands  should  not  be  larger  than  #30  AWG.\nGrounding cables have flexible, transparent elastomer or\nthermoplastic jackets primarily for mechanical protection\nof the conductor it covers and to allow visual examination\nof  stranding  degradation.  Connections  should  be  crim‐\nped  according  to  manufacturer  instructions.  The  lugs\nshould  be  rated  for  the  cables  to  be  clamped.  In  perma‐\nnent  equipment  installations  the  cable  conductor  size\nshould  be  sized  no  smaller  than  #10  AWG  stranded  and\ncapable of safely carrying the potential discharge current.\nFor  temporary  or  benchtop  situations,  the  conductor\nshould   be   capable   of   safely   carrying   any   potential\ndischarge current. Ground sticks should never be fused.\nCopyright National Fire Protection Association \nProvided by IHS Markit under license with NFPA\n\n\nINFORMATIVE ANNEX R\n70E–106\nShaded text = Revisions. Δ = Text deletions and figure/table revisions.    • = Section deletions. N = New material.\nNR.16.3  Installation.  Installation is as follows:\n(1)Connection to building grounding system: Ground sticks\nshould be connected to the building grounding electrode\nsystem  where  practicable.  A  qualified  engineer  should\nevaluate the connection point to the building grounding\nsystem to ensure the integrity of the ground stick system.\nThis connection should be in a location accessible to and\nvisible to the operator of the ground stick. Ground sticks\nshould  be  connected  such  that  impedance  is  less  than\n0.1  ohms  to  ground.  High-Z  ground  sticks  should  be\nconnected  such  that  impedance  is  less  than  0.1  ohms\nbetween the resistor and the ground connection.\n(2)Operator  access:  The  ground  sticks  should  be  perma‐\nnently grounded and stored in the immediate area of the\nequipment  in  a  manner  that  ensures  they  are  used.  The\napproach path to the equipment being grounded should\nbe perpendicular to the equipment and clear of debris or\nobstructions.  The  ground  stick  operator  will  then  always\nbe  facing  the  potential  hazard  and  have  the  grounded\nconductor  between  them  and  the  potentially  energized\nequipment. For cases of capacitors in a field situation, or\nin  portable  equipment,  a  portable  ground  stick  may  be\nused.  The  ground  stick  must  be  effectively  connected  to\nthe system ground, by a bolt or heavy-duty clamp, before\nopening the enclosure.\nNR.16.4  Visual Inspection.  Visual inspection is as follows:\n(1)The ground stick should be visually inspected for defects\nbefore use each day.\n(2)If any defect or contamination that could adversely affect\nthe  insulating  qualities  or  mechanical  integrity  of  the\nground stick is present, the tool should be removed from\nservice.  All  mechanical  connections  should  be  examined\nfor loose connections. Ground sticks should have a hand\nguard that reduces the risk of improper hand position.\n(3)If  the  defect  or  contamination  exists  on  the  grounding\nstick, then it should be replaced.\n(4)If the defect or contamination exists on the cable, then it\nshould  be  replaced  or  repaired  and  tested  before  return\nto service.\nNR.16.5 Biennial Testing (every 2 years).  A ground stick system\nplaces a grounded conductor at the end of the rod between the\noperator  and  the  electrical  hazard.  The  low  impedance  (Low-\nZ) ground stick system is not a live line tool, and there will not\nbe a voltage potential at the end of the ground stick rod. High-\nimpedance (High-Z) ground sticks can have a voltage potential\nat the end of the rod and should be treated as live line tools.\n(1)For  all  ground  sticks:  The  ground  stick  system  should  be\ntested  to  verify  that  impedance  is  less  than  0.1  ohms  to\nground.  This  test  should  be  performed  annually  when  it\nis located outside or under any other adverse conditions.\n(2)All   High-Z   ground   stick   insulating   rods   should   be\nremoved from service to be recertified to the ASTM F711,\nStandard  Specification  for  Fiberglass-Reinforced  Plastic  (FRP)\nRod  and  Tube  Used  in  Live  Line  Tools,  standard  or  equiva‐\nlent.\n(3)High-Z  ground  sticks  with  resistors:  The  resistor  on  the\nHigh-Z  ground  stick  should  be  measured  and  compared\nto the specified value.\nNR.17  References.\n  IEC TS 60479-1, 4th Edition (2005), Effects of\nCurrent  on  Human  Beings  and  Livestock,  Part  1,  General  Aspects,\nGeneva, Switzerland.\nIEC  TS  60479-2,  3rd  Edition  (2007),  Effects  of  Current  on\nHuman Beings and Livestock, Part 2, Special Aspects, Geneva, Swit‐\nzerland.\nDOE-HDBK-1092-2013,   DOE   Handbook   for   Electrical   Safety,\nU.S. Department of Energy, Washington, DC.\nDalziel,  Charles  F.,  “A  Study  of  the  Hazards  of  Impulse\nCurrents,”  Transactions  of  the  American  Institute  of  Electrical  Engi‐\nneers.

  Input accepted from the public or other committees for \nconsideration to develop the First Draft\n•   Technical Committee holds First Draft Meeting to revise \nStandard (23 weeks); Technical Committee(s) with Cor-\nrelating Committee (10 weeks)\n•   Technical Committee ballots on First Draft (12 weeks);\n   Technical Committee(s) with Correlating Committee \n(11 weeks)\n•   Correlating Committee First Draft Meeting (9 weeks)\n•   Correlating Committee ballots on First Draft (5 weeks)\n•   First Draft Report posted on the document information \npage\nStep 2 – Comment Stage\n•   Public Comments accepted on First Draft (10 weeks) fol-\nlowing posting of First Draft Report\n•   If Standard does not receive Public Comments and the \nTechnical Committee chooses not to hold a Second Draft \nmeeting, the Standard becomes a Consent Standard and \nis sent directly to the Standards Council for issuance (see \nStep 4) or\n•   Technical Committee holds Second Draft Meeting \n(21 weeks); Technical Committee(s) with Correlating \nCommittee (7 weeks)\n•  Technical Committee ballots on Second Draft (11 weeks);\n   Technical Committee(s) with Correlating Committee \n(10 weeks)\n•   Correlating Committee Second Draft Meeting (9 weeks)\n•   Correlating Committee ballots on Second Draft  \n(8 weeks)\n•   Second Draft Report posted on the document informa-\ntion page\nStep 3 – NFPA Technical Meeting\n•   Notice of Intent to Make a Motion (NITMAM) accepted \n(5 weeks) following the posting of Second Draft Report\n•   NITMAMs are reviewed and valid motions are certified \nby the Motions Committee for presentation at the NFPA \nTechnical Meeting\n•   NFPA membership meets each June at the NFPA Techni-\ncal Meeting to act on Standards with “Certified Amend-\ning Motions” (certified NITMAMs)\n•   Committee(s) vote on any successful amendments to the \nTechnical Committee Reports made by the NFPA mem-\nbership at the NFPA Technical Meeting\nStep 4 – Council Appeals and Issuance of Standard\n•   Notification of intent to file an appeal to the Standards \nCouncil on Technical Meeting action must be filed within \n20 days of the NFPA Technical Meeting\n•   Standards Council decides, based on all evidence, \nwhether to issue the standard or to take other action\nNotes:\n1. Time periods are approximate; refer to published sched-\nules for actual dates.\n2. Annual revision cycle documents with certified amend-\ning motions take approximately 101 weeks to complete.\n3. Fall revision cycle documents receiving certified amend-\ning motions take approximately 141 weeks to complete.\nCommittee Membership \nClassifications\n1,2,3,4\nThe following classifications apply to Committee members \nand represent their principal interest in the activity of the \nCommittee.\n1.  M  Manufacturer: A representative of a maker or mar-\nketer of a product, assembly, or system, or portion \nthereof, that is affected by the standard.\n2.  U  User: A representative of an entity that is subject to \nthe provisions of the standard or that voluntarily \nuses the standard.\n3.  IM  Installer/Maintainer: A representative of an entity that \nis in the business of installing or maintaining a prod-\nuct, assembly, or system affected by the standard.\n4.  L  Labor: A labor representative or employee concerned \nwith safety in the workplace.\n5.  RT  Applied Research/Testing Laboratory: A representative \nof an independent testing laboratory or indepen-\ndent applied research organization that promulgates \nand/or enforces standards.\n6.

Applicable Regulations. The primary rules governing the processing of NFPA standards (codes, standards, \nrecommended practices, and guides) are the NFPA Regulations Governing the Development of NFPA Standards (Regs). Other \napplicable rules include NFPA Bylaws, NFPA Technical Meeting Convention Rules, NFPA Guide for the Conduct of Participants in \nthe NFPA Standards Development Process, and the NFPA Regulations Governing Petitions to the Board of Directors from Decisions of \nthe Standards Council. Most of these rules and regulations are contained in the NFPA Standards Directory. For copies of the \nDirectory, contact Codes and Standards Administration at NFPA headquarters; all these documents are also available on the \nNFPA website at “www.nfpa.org/regs.” \nThe following is general information on the NFPA process. All participants, however, should refer to the actual rules and \nregulations for a full understanding of this process and for the criteria that govern participation. \nII. Technical Committee Report. The Technical Committee Report is defined as “the Report of the responsible \nCommittee(s), in accordance with the Regulations, in preparation of a new or revised NFPA Standard.” The Technical \nCommittee Report is in two parts and consists of the First Draft Report and the Second Draft Report. (See Regs at  \nSection 1.4.)\nIII. Step 1: First Draft Report. The First Draft Report is defined as “Part one of the Technical Committee Report, which \ndocuments the Input Stage.” The First Draft Report consists of the First Draft, Public Input, Committee Input, Committee \nand Correlating Committee Statements, Correlating Notes, and Ballot Statements. (See Regs at 4.2.5.2 and Section 4.3.) \nAny objection to an action in the First Draft Report must be raised through the filing of an appropriate Comment for \nconsideration in the Second Draft Report or the objection will be considered resolved. [See Regs at 4.3.1(b).]\nIV. Step 2: Second Draft Report. The Second Draft Report is defined as “Part two of the Technical Committee Report, \nwhich documents the Comment Stage.” The Second Draft Report consists of the Second Draft, Public Comments with \ncorresponding Committee Actions and Committee Statements, Correlating Notes and their respective Committee \nStatements, Committee Comments, Correlating Revisions, and Ballot Statements. (See Regs at 4.2.5.2 and Section 4.4.) \nThe First Draft Report and the Second Draft Report together constitute the Technical Committee Report. Any outstanding  \nobjection following the Second Draft Report must be raised through an appropriate Amending Motion at the NFPA \nTechnical Meeting or the objection will be considered resolved. [See Regs at 4.4.1(b).]\nV. Step 3a: Action at NFPA Technical Meeting. Following the publication of the Second Draft Report, there is a period \nduring which those wishing to make proper Amending Motions on the Technical Committee Reports must signal their \nintention by submitting a Notice of Intent to Make a Motion (NITMAM). (See Regs at 4.5.2.) Standards that receive \nnotice of proper Amending Motions (Certified Amending Motions) will be presented for action at the annual June NFPA \nTechnical Meeting. At the meeting, the NFPA membership can consider and act on these Certified Amending Motions as \nwell as Follow-up Amending Motions, that is, motions that become necessary as a result of a previous successful Amending \nMotion. (See 4.5.3.2 through 4.5.3.6 and Table 1, Columns 1-3 of Regs for a summary of the available Amending Motions \nand who may make them.) Any outstanding objection following action at an NFPA Technical Meeting (and any further \nTechnical Committee consideration following successful Amending Motions, see Regs at 4.5.3.7 through 4.6.5) must be \nraised through an appeal to the Standards Council or it will be considered to be resolved. \nVI. Step 3b: Documents Forwarded Directly to the Council. Where no NITMAM is received and certified in accordance \nwith the Technical Meeting Convention Rules, the standard is forwarded directly to the Standards Council for action on \nissuance. Objections are deemed to be resolved for these documents. (See Regs at 4.5.2.5.)\nVII. Step 4a: Council Appeals. Anyone can appeal to the Standards Council concerning procedural or substantive matters \nrelated to the development, content, or issuance of any document of the NFPA or on matters within the purview of the \nauthority of the Council, as established by the Bylaws and as determined by the Board of Directors. Such appeals must be in \nwritten form and filed with the Secretary of the Standards Council (see Regs at Section 1.6). Time constraints for filing an \nappeal must be in accordance with 1.6.2 of the Regs. Objections are deemed to be resolved if not pursued at this level. \nVIII. Step 4b: Document Issuance. The Standards Council is the issuer of all documents (see Article 8 of Bylaws). The \nCouncil acts on the issuance of a document presented for action at an NFPA Technical Meeting within 75 days from the \ndate of the recommendation from the NFPA Technical Meeting, unless this period is extended by the Council (see Regs at \n4.7.2). For documents forwarded directly to the Standards Council, the Council acts on the issuance of the document at its \nnext scheduled meeting, or at such other meeting as the Council may determine (see Regs at 4.5.2.5 and 4.7.4). \nIX. Petitions to the Board of Directors. The Standards Council has been delegated the responsibility for the \nadministration of the codes and standards development process and the issuance of documents. However, where \nextraordinary circumstances requiring the intervention of the Board of Directors exist, the Board of Directors may take \nany action necessary to fulfill its obligations to preserve the integrity of the codes and standards development process \nand to protect the interests of the NFPA. The rules for petitioning the Board of Directors can be found in the Regulations \nGoverning Petitions to the Board of Directors from Decisions of the Standards Council and in Section 1.7 of the Regs. \nX. For More Information. The program for the NFPA Technical Meeting (as well as the NFPA website as information \nbecomes available) should be consulted for the date on which each report scheduled for consideration at the meeting will \nbe presented. To view the First Draft Report and Second Draft Report as well as information on NFPA rules and for up-to-\ndate information on schedules and deadlines for processing NFPA documents, check the NFPA website (www.nfpa.org/\ndocinfo) or contact NFPA Codes & Standards Administration at (617) 984-7246. \n4/19-C\nCopyright National Fire Protection Association \nProvided by IHS Markit under license with NFPA\n\n\nCopyright National Fire Protection Association \nProvided by IHS Markit under license with NFPA\n",

        "content": "(1) OSHA could only adopt or modify a standard through procedures that provide for public\nnotice, opportunity for public comment, and public hearings. The adoption of a new NEC edition by\nthese procedures would require extensive effort and application of resources by OSHA and others.\nGoing through the procedures might result in requirements substantially different from those of the\nNEC, thereby creating a conflict between the two standards.\n(2) The NEC is intended for use primarily by those who design, install, and inspect electrical\ninstallations. Most of the NEC requirements are not electrical safety–related work practices, electrical\nsystem maintenance, or directly related to employee safety. However, OSHA electrical regulations,\nwhich address employers and employees in their workplaces, needed to consider and develop these\nsafety areas.\nIt became apparent that a need existed for a new standard tailored to fulfill OSHA's\nresponsibilities that would still be fully consistent with the NEC. This led to the concept of a new\ndocument that would extract suitable portions from the NEC and from other documents applicable\nto electrical safety. This concept and an offer of assistance was submitted in May 1975 to the Assistant\nSecretary of Labor for OSHA, who responded as follows: \"The concept, procedures, and scope of the\neffort discussed with my staff for preparing the subject standard appear to have great merit, and an\napparent need exists for this proposed consensus document which OSHA could consider for\npromulgation under the provisions of Section 6(b) of the Act. OSHA does have an interest in this\neffort and believes the proposed standard would serve a useful purpose.\" With this positive\nencouragement from OSHA, the NFPA Electrical Section unanimously supported a\nrecommendation that the NEC Correlating Committee examine the feasibility of developing a\ndocument for evaluating electrical safety in the workplace. With recommendations from the\nElectrical Section and Correlating Committee, the Standards Council authorized the establishment\nof a committee to carry out this examination.\nThe committee would develop a standard for electrical installations that would be compatible\nwith the OSHA requirements for employee safety in locations covered by the NEC. The standard was\nvisualized as consisting of four major parts: Part I, Installation Safety Requirements; Part II, Safety-\nRelated Work Practices; Part III, Safety-Related Maintenance Requirements; and Part IV, Safety\nRequirements for Special Equipment. It was not considered essential for all of the parts to be\ncompleted before the standard was published and made available. Each part was recognized as being\nCopyright National Fire Protection Association \nProvided by IHS Markit under license with NFPA\n\n\nELECTRICAL SAFETY IN THE WORKPLACE\n70E–2\nELECTRICAL SAFETY IN THE WORKPLACE    2021 Edition\nan important aspect of electrical safety in the workplace, but the parts were sufficiently independent of each other to permit\ntheir separate publication. The first edition of NFPA 70E, Standard for Electrical Safety Requirements for Employee Workplaces, was\npublished in 1979 and included only Part I, Installation Safety Requirements.\nThe second edition published in 1981 included a new Part II, Safety-Related Work Practices. In 1983, the third edition\nadded a new Part III, Safety-Related Maintenance Requirements. In 1988, the fourth edition was published with only minor\nrevisions.\nThe 1995 edition included major revisions to Part I to conform to the 1993 edition of the NEC. The concepts of \"limits of\napproach\" and establishment of an \"arc\" were introduced in Part II. In 2000, the sixth edition included an update of Part I to\nthe 1999 NEC, as well as a new Part IV, Safety Requirements for Special Equipment. Part II continued to focus on establishing\nflash protection boundaries and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Also, charts were added to Part II to assist in\napplying appropriate protective clothing and personal protective equipment for common tasks.\nThe 2004 edition presented several significant changes. The major changes emphasized safe work practices. Clarity and\nusability of the document were also enhanced. The title was changed to Standard for Electrical Safety in the Workplace. The\ndocument was reformatted to comply with the National Electrical Code Style Manual. The existing parts were renamed as chapters\nand were reorganized with the safety-related work practices relocated to the front of the document to highlight the emphasis,\nfollowed by safety-related maintenance requirements, safety requirements for special equipment, and safety-related installation\nrequirements. The chapter on safety-related work practices also was reorganized to emphasize that working on live parts is the\nlast alternative work practice. An energized electrical work permit and related requirements were incorporated into the\ndocument.\nThis standard is compatible with the NEC but is not intended to be used, nor can it be used, in lieu of the NEC. Chapter 4,\nSpecific Purpose Equipment and Installations, was intended to serve a very specific need of OSHA. It was not intended to be\napplied as a design, installation, modification, or construction standard for an electrical installation or system. Its content was\nintentionally limited in comparison to the NEC in order to apply to an electrical installation or a system as part of an\nemployee's workplace. Chapter 4 was updated to correlate with the 2002 edition of the NEC, but requirements not directly\nassociated with employee safety were not included. Omission of NEC requirements did not affect the NEC, nor were omitted\nrequirements considered as unimportant. They are essential to the NEC and its intended application — that is, its use by those\nwho design, install, and inspect electrical installations. NFPA 70E, on the other hand, is intended for use by employers,\nemployees, and OSHA.\nRequirements were upgraded throughout the 2009 edition. Chapter 4 was deleted because it was a duplicate of NEC\ninstallation requirements. Article 350 was added for R&D facilities. Other changes included significant revisions to Annex D,\nAnnex F, and Annex J and the addition of Annex M, Annex N, and Annex O.\nThe 2012 edition marked another waypoint as this standard continued to evolve to meet the electrical safety needs of\nemployers and employees. New research, new technology, and technical input from users provided the foundation for new and\nrevised requirements that addressed the electrical hazards encountered by employees in current workplaces. Expanded or\nclarified requirements, inclusion of technical material not previously covered, and removal of requirements related to the safe\ninstallation of electrical equipment rather than being safe electrical work practices were some of the major actions undertaken\nduring the revision cycle. In addition, requirements covering the separate but directly related concepts of hazard identification\nand risk assessment were revised to clarify the concepts. A significant revision to Annex F provided extensive coverage of this\ntopic to assist users with implementing effective hazard identification and risk assessment procedures. Annex P on aligning\nNFPA 70E implementation with occupational health and safety management standards was added.\nThe majority of changes occurred in Chapter 1. Article 105, Application of Safety-Related Work Practices, and a\nrequirement for hearing protection when working within an arc flash boundary were added, as were work practice\nrequirements on the use of GFCIs to protect employees. Clarification was made that Article 130 applies whether incident\nenergy analysis or the hazard/risk table was used to determine use and level of PPE. Short-circuit current, fault clearing time,\nand arc flash boundary information were included in the hazard/risk category tables. Another major revision included\nchanging \"flame-resistant (FR)\" to \"arc-rated (AR)\" in regard to PPE.\nThe 2015 edition incorporated a major shift in how stakeholders evaluate electrical risk. In support of this, new definitions\nfor hazard, hazardous, risk, and risk assessment were added to Article 100. Throughout the document, changes were made to\nprovide clarity to users, such as changing hazard analysis to risk assessment. These global changes ensured consistent use of these\nterms throughout the document and provided consistency between NFPA 70E and other standards that address hazards and\nrisk. Other major revisions included the following:\n(1) The definition of a qualified person was revised to correlate with the OSHA definition.\n(2) Safety-related maintenance requirements and other administrative controls were added to the scope statement to clarify\nthat training and auditing are equally important safety-related work practices.\n(3) An electrical safety program must consider condition of maintenance.\nCopyright National Fire Protection Association \nProvided by IHS Markit under license with NFPA\n\n\nORIGIN & DEVELOPMENT\n2021 Edition    ELECTRICAL SAFETY IN THE WORKPLACE\n70E–3\n(4) Clarification was provided that the equipment owner or the owner’s designated representative is responsible for\nmaintenance of the electrical equipment and documentation."

The revision clarified that the results of an incident energy\nanalysis is not permitted to be used to specify an arc flash PPE category.\n(8) A new task-based table combined the previously separate ac and dc tables used to determine when arc flash PPE is\nrequired and made them consistent, improving usability.\n(9) New equipment-based tables were added for determining the arc flash PPE category for ac systems and for dc systems.\n(10) Hazard/risk category 0 was removed because the new PPE table only specifies PPE for work within the arc flash\nboundary. Hazard/risk category was also changed to PPE category.\n(11) Prohibited approach boundary was deleted because additional protective equipment was not required when crossing\nthis boundary.\n(12) The criterion to use insulated tools or handling equipment was changed from the limited approach boundary to\nrestricted approach boundary.\n(13) All references to bare-hand work were removed. This work is considered to be a \"utility type\" line work technique more\nappropriately addressed in other standards.\n(14) Field-marked equipment labeling requirements were revised to require an updated label when the arc flash hazard risk\nassessment identifies a change that renders the label inaccurate.\n(15) A risk assessment is required prior to any work on a battery system to identify the chemical, electrical shock, and arc\nflash hazards and assess the risks associated with the type of tasks to be performed.\nThe 2018 edition continued to evolve to address risk assessment and introduce human factors, such as human error, as part\nof that assessment. Annex Q, Human Performance and Workplace Electrical Safety, was included to provide guidance in this\narea. This edition emphasized the need to use the hierarchy of risk controls by moving it from an informational note into the\ntext of the standard. NFPA 70E explicitly stated that the first priority must be the elimination of the hazard.\nThe previous arc flash hazard identification table [Table 130.7(C)(15)(A)(a)] was modified to determine the likelihood\nthat an arc flash could occur and renumbered as Table 130.5(C). This modified table could be used with either method of arc\nflash risk assessment.\nThe most notable change for the 2018 edition was that tables and text that specified PPE standards were moved to\ninformational tables or notes. In previous editions employers were, and still are, required to verify that appropriate PPE is\ngiven to employees. Section 130.7(C)(14)(b) was added to provide guidance on conformity assessment of PPE. These changes\ndid not alter the employer’s responsibility for determining the validity of the PPE manufacturer’s claims.\nDefinitions for fault current and available fault current were added, and other terms used throughout the standard for this\ncurrent were changed for consistency. Article 120 was rearranged to present the requirements for establishing an electrically\nsafe work condition in a logical order of application of the program. Article 320 introduced voltage thresholds of 50 Vac and\n100 Vdc specifically for batteries and battery rooms to address the unique situations in these locations. Article 330 addressing\nlasers was extensively revised to address safety-related maintenance issues rather than issues associated with laser use. Article\n350 introduced an Electrical Safety Authority as a possible authority having jurisdiction for laboratories.\nFor the 2021 edition, Article 110 was revised to incorporate the general requirements for electrical safety-related work\nprograms, practices, and procedures from other articles. The reference to arc-resistant switchgear has been changed to arc-\nresistant equipment in Tables 130.5(C) and 130.7(C)(15)(a) to address the use of other types of arc-resistant equipment.\nArticle 360, Safety-Related Requirements for Capacitors, and Annex R, Working with Capacitors, were added to address specific\nelectrical safety requirements unique to capacitors. Annex D, Incident Energy and Arc Flash Boundary Calculation Methods,\nwas revised to reference IEEE-1584-2018 as a method of calculation.\nCopyright National Fire Protection Association \nProvided by IHS Markit under license with NFPA\n\n\nELECTRICAL SAFETY IN THE WORKPLACE\n70E–4\nELECTRICAL SAFETY IN THE WORKPLACE    2021 Edition\nContents\n90\nIntroduction .........................................................\n70E– 8\nChapter 1 Safety-Related Work Practices\n100\nDefinitions ............................................................\n70E– 10\n105\nApplication of Safety-Related Work Practices\nand Procedures ....................................................70E– 15\n110\nGeneral Requirements for Electrical Safety-\nRelated Work Practices ........................................70E– 15\n120\nEstablishing an Electrically Safe Work\nCondition .............................................................70E– 20\n130\nWork Involving Electrical Hazards ......................\n70E– 24\nChapter 2 Safety-Related Maintenance Requirements\n200\nIntroduction .........................................................\n70E– 42\n205\nGeneral Maintenance Requirements ..................\n70E– 42\n210\nSubstations, Switchgear Assemblies,\nSwitchboards, Panelboards, Motor Control\nCenters, and Disconnect Switches ......................70E– 43\n215\nPremises Wiring ...................................................\n70E– 43\n220\nController Equipment .........................................\n70E– 43\n225\nFuses and Circuit Breakers ..................................\n70E– 43\n230\nRotating Equipment ............................................\n70E– 43\n235\nHazardous (Classified) Locations .......................\n70E– 44\n240\nBatteries and Battery Rooms ...............................\n70E– 44\n245\nPortable Electric Tools and Equipment .............\n70E– 44\n250\nPersonal Safety and Protective Equipment ........\n70E– 44"

The  purpose  of  this  standard  is  to  provide  a\npractical   safe   working   area   for   employees   relative   to   the\nhazards arising from the use of electricity.\n90.2  Scope.\n(A)  Covered.  This  standard  addresses  electrical  safety-related\nwork  practices,  safety-related  maintenance  requirements,  and\nother administrative controls for employee workplaces that are\nnecessary  for  the  practical  safeguarding  of  employees  relative\nto the hazards associated with electrical energy during activities\nsuch as the installation, removal, inspection, operation, mainte‐\nnance,  and  demolition  of  electric  conductors,  electric  equip‐\nment,    signaling    and    communications    conductors    and\nequipment, and raceways.

Risk assessment is an overall\nprocess that involves estimating both the likelihood of occurrence and severity to determine if additional\nprotective measures are required. The estimate of the likelihood of occurrence contained in this table does\nnot cover every possible condition or situation, nor does it address severity of injury or damage to health.\nWhere this table identifies “No” as an estimate of likelihood of occurrence, it means that an arc flash incident\nis not likely to occur. Where this table identifies “Yes” as an estimate of likelihood of occurrence, it means an\narc flash incident should be considered likely to occur. The likelihood of occurrence must be combined with\nthe potential severity of the arcing incident to determine if additional protective measures are required to be\nselected and implemented according to the hierarchy of risk control identified in 110.5(H)(3).\nInformational Note No. 1: An example of a standard that provides information for arc-resistant\nequipment referred to in Table 130.5(C) is IEEE C37.20.7, Guide for Testing Switchgear Rated Up to 52 kV\nfor Internal Arcing Faults.\nInformational Note No. 2: Improper or inadequate maintenance can result in increased fault clearing\ntime of the overcurrent protective device, thus increasing the incident energy. Where equipment is not\nproperly installed or maintained, PPE selection based on incident energy analysis or the PPE category\nmethod might not provide adequate protection from arc flash hazards.\nInformational Note No. 3: Both larger and smaller available fault currents could result in higher\nincident energy. If the available fault current increases without a decrease in the fault clearing time of\nthe overcurrent protective device, the incident energy will increase. If the available fault current\ndecreases, resulting in a longer fault clearing time for the overcurrent protective device, incident\nenergy could also increase.\nInformational Note No. 4: The occurrence of an arcing fault inside an enclosure produces a variety of\nphysical phenomena very different from a bolted fault. For example, the arc energy resulting from an\narc developed in the air will cause a sudden pressure increase and localized overheating. Equipment\nand design practices are available to minimize the energy levels and the number of procedures that\ncould expose an employee to high levels of incident energy. Proven designs such as arc-resistant\nswitchgear, remote racking (insertion or removal), remote opening and closing of switching devices,\nhigh-resistance grounding of low-voltage and 5000-volt (nominal) systems, current limitation, and\nspecification of covered bus or covered conductors within equipment are available to reduce the risk\nassociated with an arc flash incident. See Informative Annex O for safety-related design requirements.\nInformational Note No. 5: For additional direction for performing maintenance on overcurrent\nprotective devices, see Chapter 2, Safety-Related Maintenance Requirements.\nInformational Note No. 6: See IEEE 1584, Guide for Performing Arc Flash Hazard Calculations, for more\ninformation regarding incident energy and the arc flash boundary for three-phase systems.\nCopyright National Fire Protection Association \nProvided by IHS Markit under license with NFPA\n\n\nARTICLE 130 — WORK INVOLVING ELECTRICAL HAZARDS\n130.5\nShaded text = Revisions.

Power system modeling is the best method to determine the available short-circuit current at the point of the arc. Battery cell short-\ncircuit current can be obtained from the battery manufacturer. See D.5 for the basis for table values and alternative methods to determine dc\nincident energy. Methods should be used with good engineering judgment.\nInformational Note No. 2: The methods for estimating the dc arc flash incident energy that were used to determine the categories for this\ntable are based on open-air incident energy calculations. Open-air calculations were used because many battery systems and other dc process\nsystems are in open areas or rooms. If the specific task is within an enclosure, it would be prudent to consider additional PPE protection\nbeyond the value shown in this table.\nCopyright National Fire Protection Association \nProvided by IHS Markit under license with NFPA\n\n\nARTICLE 130 — WORK INVOLVING ELECTRICAL HAZARDS\n130.7\nShaded text = Revisions.

N = New material.\n70E–47\nwith  the  nature  and  extent  of  the  related  electrical  hazards.\nSafeguards  might  be  different  for  energized  cell  lines  and  de-\nenergized  cell  lines.  Hazardous  battery  effect  voltages  shall  be\ndissipated to consider a cell line de-energized.\nInformational  Note  No.  1:  Exposed  energized  surfaces  might\nnot  present  an  electrical  hazard.  Shock  hazards  are  related  to\ncurrent through the body, producing possible injury or damage\nto health. Shock severity is a function of many factors, including\nskin  and  body  resistance,  current  path  through  the  body,  paths\nin  parallel  with  the  body,  and  system  voltage.  Arc  flash  burns\nand arc blasts are a function of the arcing current and the dura‐\ntion of arc exposure.\nInformational Note No. 2: A cell line or group of cell lines oper‐\nated  as  a  unit  for  the  production  of  a  particular  metal,  gas,  or\nchemical  compound  might  differ  from  other  cell  lines  produc‐\ning the same product because of variations in the particular raw\nmaterials  used,  output  capacity,  use  of  proprietary  methods  or\nprocess  practices,  or  other  modifying  factors.  Detailed  standard\nelectrical   safety-related   work   practice   requirements   could\nbecome   overly   restrictive   without   accomplishing   the   stated\npurpose of Chapter 1.\n(B)  Signs.  Permanent  signs  shall  clearly  designate  electrolytic\ncell areas.\n(C) Arc  Flash  Risk  Assessment.  The  requirements  of  130.5,\nArc Flash Risk Assessment, shall not \nbe required for electrolytic\ncell line working zones.\n(1)  General.  Each  task  performed  in  the  electrolytic  cell  line\nworking  zone  shall  be  analyzed  for  the  likelihood  of  arc  flash\ninjury.  If  there  is  a  likelihood  of  personal  injury,  appropriate\nmeasures  shall  be  taken  to  protect  persons  exposed  to  the  arc\nflash hazards, including one or more of the following:\n(1)Providing  appropriate  PPE  [see  310.5(D)(2)]  to  prevent\ninjury from the arc flash hazard\n(2)Altering  work  procedures  to  reduce  the  likelihood  of\noccurrence of an arc flash incident\n(3)Scheduling the task so that work can be performed when\nthe cell line is de-energized\n(2) Routine  Tasks.  Arc  flash  risk  assessment  shall  be  done  for\nall  routine  tasks  performed  in  the  cell  line  work  zone.  The\nresults of the arc flash risk assessment shall be used in training\nemployees  in  job  procedures  that  minimize  the  possibility  of\narc flash hazards. The training shall be included in the require‐\nments of 310.3.\n(3) Nonroutine  Tasks.  Before  a  nonroutine  task  is  performed\nin the cell line working zone, an arc flash risk assessment shall\nbe  done.  If  an  arc  flash  hazard  is  a  possibility  during  nonrou‐\ntine work, appropriate instructions shall be given to employees\ninvolved on how to minimize the risk associated with arc flash.\n(4) Arc  Flash  Hazards.  If  the  likelihood  of  occurrence  of  an\narc  flash  hazard  exists  for  either  routine  or  nonroutine  tasks,\nemployees shall use appropriate safeguards.\n(D)  Safeguards.  Safeguards  shall  include  one  or  a  combina‐\ntion of the following means.\n(1)  Insulation.  Insulation   shall   be   suitable   for   the   specific\nconditions,  and  its  components  shall  be  permitted  to  include\nglass,  porcelain,  epoxy  coating,  rubber,  fiberglass,  and  plastic\nand,  when  dry,  such  materials  as  concrete,  tile,  brick,  and\nwood. Insulation shall be permitted to be applied to energized\nor grounded surfaces.\n(2) Personal  Protective  Equipment  (PPE).  PPE  shall  provide\nprotection  from  electrical  hazards.

Barriers shall be devices that prevent contact with\nenergized or grounded surfaces that could present an electrical\nhazard.\n(4) Voltage Equalization.  Voltage equalization shall be permit‐\nted  by  bonding  a  conductive  surface  to  an  exposed  energized\nsurface, either directly or through a resistance, so that there is\ninsufficient voltage to create an electrical hazard.\n(5)  Isolation.  Isolation  shall  be  established  by  placing  equip‐\nment  or  other  items  in  locations  such  that  employees  are\nunable  to  simultaneously  contact  exposed  conductive  surfaces\nthat could present an electrical hazard.\n(6) Safe  Work  Practices.  Employees  shall  be  trained  in  safe\nwork practices. The training shall include why the work practi‐\nces  in  a  cell  line  working  zone  are  different  from  similar  work\nsituations  in  other  areas  of  the  plant.  Employees  shall  comply\nwith established safe work practices and the safe use of protec‐\ntive equipment.\n(a)     Attitude  Awareness.  Safe  work  practice  training  shall\ninclude  attitude  awareness  instruction.  Simultaneous  contact\nwith  energized  parts  and  ground  can  cause  serious  electrical\nshock.  Of  special  importance  is  the  need  to  be  aware  of  body\nposition  where  contact  may  be  made  with  energized  parts  of\nthe electrolytic cell line and grounded surfaces.\n(b)     Bypassing of Safety Equipment. Safe work practice train‐\ning  shall  include  techniques  to  prevent  bypassing  the  protec‐\ntion   of   safety   equipment.   Clothing   may   bypass   protective\nequipment if the clothing is wet. Trouser legs should be kept at\nappropriate length, and shirt sleeves should be a good fit so as\nnot  to  drape  while  reaching.  Jewelry  and  other  metal  accesso‐\nries  that  may  bypass  protective  equipment  shall  not  be  worn\nwhile working in the cell line working zone.\n(7)  Tools.  Tools  and  other  devices  used  in  the  energized  cell\nline  work  zone  shall  be  selected  to  prevent  bridging  between\nsurfaces at hazardous potential difference.\nInformational  Note:  Tools  and  other  devices  of  magnetic  mate‐\nrial  could  be  difficult  to  handle  in  the  area  of  energized  cells\ndue to their strong dc magnetic fields.\n(8) Portable    Cutout-Type    Switches.  Portable    cell    cutout\nswitches  that  are  connected  shall  be  considered  as  energized\nand as an extension of the cell line working zone.

The  type  of  condi‐\ntions    monitored    will    vary    depending    upon    the    battery\ntechnology.  One  source  of  guidance  on  monitoring  battery\nsystems is IEEE 1491, Guide for the Selection and Use of Battery Moni‐\ntoring Equipment in Stationary Applications.\n(6) Warning Signs.  The following warning signs or labels shall\nbe posted in appropriate locations:\n(1)Electrical  hazard  warnings  indicating  the  shock  hazard\ndue to the battery voltage and the arc flash hazard due to\nthe  prospective  short-circuit  current,  and  the  thermal\nhazard.\nInformational Note No.1: Because internal resistance, prospec‐\ntive short-circuit current, or both are not always provided on\nbattery container labels or data sheets, and because many varia‐\nbles can be introduced into a battery layout, the battery manu‐\nfacturer should be consulted for accurate data. Variables can\ninclude, but are not limited to, the following:\n(1)Series connections\n(2)Parallel connections\n(3)Charging methodology\n(4)Temperature\n(5)Charge status\n(6)Dc distribution cable size and length\nInformational Note No. 2: See 130.5(D) for requirements\nfor equipment labeling.\n(2)Chemical  hazard  warnings,  applicable  to  the  worst  case\nwhen  multiple  battery  types  are  installed  in  the  same\nspace, indicating the following:\na.Potential  presence  of  explosive  gas  (when  applicable\nto the battery type)\nb.Prohibition of open flame and smoking\nc.Danger of chemical burns from the electrolyte (when\napplicable to the battery type)\n(3)Notice  for  personnel  to  use  and  wear  protective  equip‐\nment  and  apparel  appropriate  to  the  hazard  for  the\nbattery\n(4)Notice prohibiting access to unauthorized personnel\n(B)  Electrolyte Hazards.\n(1) Battery Activities That Include Handling of Liquid Electro‐\nlyte.

Batteries  \nthat  are  hermetically\nsealed  (such  as  most  lithium  batteries)  or  immobilized  electro‐\nlyte (such as valve-regulated lead acid batteries) present little or\nno  electrolyte  hazard.  Most  modern  density  meters  expose  a\nworker  to  a  quantity  of  electrolyte  too  minute  to  be  considered\nhazardous,   if   at   all.   Such   work   would   not   be   considered\nhandling  electrolyte.  However,  if  specific  gravity  readings  are\ntaken using a bulb hydrometer, the risk of exposure is higher —\nthis  could  be  considered  to  be  handling  electrolyte,  and  the\nrequirements of 320.3(B)(1) would apply.\n(C) \nTools and Equipment.\nN(1)  Handles.  Tools  and  equipment  for  work  on  batteries  shall\nbe equipped with handles listed as insulated for the maximum\nworking voltage.\nN(2)  Contact.

The  following  qualifications\nand training shall be required for personnel safety:\n(1)Employees  who  perform  work  on  electrical  equipment\nwith capacitors that exceed the energy thresholds in 360.3\nshall  be  qualified  and  shall  be  trained  in,  and  familiar\nwith,  the  specific  hazards  and  controls  required  for  safe\nwork.\n(2)Unqualified   persons   who   perform   work   on   electrical\nequipment  with  capacitors  shall  be  trained  in,  and  famil‐\niar with, any electrical safety-related work practices neces‐\nsary for their safety.\nN(B) Performing  a  Risk  Assessment  for  Capacitors.  The  risk\nassessment  process  for  capacitors  shall  follow  the  overall  risk\nassessment  procedures  in  Chapter  1.  If  additional  protective\nmeasures are required, they shall be selected and implemented\naccording   to   the   hierarchy   of   risk   control   identified   in\n110.5(H)(3). When the additional protective measures include\nthe use of PPE, the following shall be determined:\n(1)Capacitor voltage and stored energy for the worker expo‐\nsure.  An  exposure  shall  be  considered  to  exist  when  a\nconductor  or  circuit  part  that  could  potentially  remain\nenergized with hazardous stored energy is exposed.\n(2)Thermal  hazard.  The  appropriate  thermal  PPE  shall  be\nselected and used if the stored energy of the exposed part\nis greater 100 joules.\n(3)Shock hazard. The appropriate shock PPE in accordance\nwith  130.7  shall  be  selected  and  used  if  the  voltage  is\ngreater than or equal to 100 volts.\n(4)Arc flash and arc blast hazard at the appropriate working\ndistance. The appropriate protection for the arc flash and\narc blast hazard shall be selected, as follows:\n(a)     Arc flash PPE in accordance with 130.7 shall be selec‐\nted and used if the incident energy exceeds 1.2 cal/cm\n2\n(5 J/cm\n2\n) at the working distance.\n(b)     Hearing protection shall be required where the\nstored energy exceeds 100 joules.\n(c)     The lung protection boundary shall be determined if\nstored energy is above 122 kJ. Employees shall not enter the\nlung protection boundary.\n(d)     Alerting techniques in accordance with 130.7(E)\nshall be used to warn employees of the hazards.\n(5)Required  test  and  grounding  method.  Soft  grounding\nshall  be  used  for  stored  energy  greater  than  1000  joules.\nIf capacitors are equipped with bleed resistors, or if using\na soft grounding system, the required discharge wait time\nshall be determined where applicable.\n(6)Develop  a  written  procedure  that  captures  all  of  the\nrequired  steps  to  place  the  equipment  in  an  electrically\nsafe   work   condition.   Include   information   about   the\namount of stored energy available, how long to wait after\nde-energization before opening the enclosure, how to test\nfor  absence  of  voltage,  and  what  to  do  if  there  is  still\nstored energy present.\nInformational Note No. 1: For more information on calculating\ncapacitor  stored  energy,  arc  flash,  and  arc  blast  boundaries,  see\nInformative Annex R, Working Safely with Capacitors.\nInformational  Note  No.  2:  Heavy  duty  leather  with  a  minimum\nthickness of 0.03 in.

Where  a  conductor  or  circuit  part  is\nconnected  to  a  capacitor(s)  operating  at  or  above  the  thresh‐\nolds  in  360.3,  a  written  procedure  shall  be  used  to  document\nthe necessary steps and sequence to discharge the capacitor(s)\nand  place  the  equipment  into  an  electrically  safe  work  condi‐\ntion. The written procedure shall incorporate the results of the\nrisk  assessment  performed  in  360.5(B)  and  specify  the  follow‐\ning at a minimum:\nN(B) Safe  Work  Practices.  In  order  to  place  the  capacitor(s)\ninto an electrically safe work condition, a qualified person shall\nuse  the  appropriate  safe  work  practices  and  PPE  and  shall\napply  the  following  process  for  establishing  and  verifying  an\nelectrically safe work condition:\n(1)Determine  all  possible  sources  of  electrical  supply  to  the\nspecific  equipment.  Check  applicable  up-to-date  draw‐\nings, diagrams, and identification tags.\n(2)After  properly  interrupting  the  load  current,  open  the\ndisconnecting device(s) for each source.\n(3)Wherever  possible,  visually  verify  that  all  blades  of  the\ndisconnecting devices are fully open or that drawout-type\ncircuit  breakers  are  withdrawn  to  the  fully  disconnected\nposition.\n(4)Apply lockout/tagout devices in accordance with a docu‐\nmented and established policy.\n(5)If bleed resistors or automatic discharge systems are appli‐\ncable,  wait  the  prescribed  time  for  the  capacitors  to\ndischarge   to   less   than   the   thresholds   in   360.3   and\nproceed to step (6). For systems without bleed resistors or\nautomatic   discharge   systems,   discharge   the   capacitors\nwith  an  adequately  rated  grounding  device  (e.g.,  ground\nstick).  Soft  grounding  shall  be  performed  above  1000\njoules,  and  remote  soft  grounding  shall  be  performed\nabove 100 kJ.\n(6)Verify  that  the  capacitors  are  discharged.  For  capacitors\nless than 1000 joules, verification shall be permitted to be\ndone  either  by  testing  or  by  grounding.  For  capacitors\nbetween  1000  joules  and  less  than  100  kJ,  verification\nshall  be  done  using  testing  or  soft  grounding,  then  hard\ngrounding.  Above  100  kJ,  an  engineered  and  redundant\nsystem  shall  be  used  for  remote  testing  and  grounding.\nAn  adequately  rated  portable  test  instrument  shall  be\nused  to  test  between  each  capacitor  terminal  and  from\nCopyright National Fire Protection Association \nProvided by IHS Markit under license with NFPA\n\n\nARTICLE 360 — SAFETY-RELATED REQUIREMENTS FOR CAPACITORS\n360.6\nShaded text = Revisions.

If  voltage  remains,  deter‐\nmine  and  correct  the  cause,  and  repeat  step  (5)  to\ndischarge  the  capacitors.  Where  recharging  can  occur\ndue  to  dielectric  absorption  or  induced  voltages,  all  the\ncapacitor   terminals   shall   be   connected   together   and\ngrounded with a bare or transparent-insulated wire.\n(8)For  series  capacitors  the  shorting  wires  shall  be  attached\nacross each individual capacitor, and to case.\nFor  single  capacitors  or  for  a  parallel  capacitor  bank,  the\ngrounding  device  shall  be  permitted  to  be  left  attached  to  the\ncapacitor terminals for the duration of the work (e.g., a ground\nstick).\nException:  Lockout/tagout  shall  not  be  required  for  work  on  cord-  and\nplug-connected equipment for which exposure to the hazards of unexpec‐\nted energization of the equipment is controlled by the unplugging of the\nequipment  from  the  energy  source,  provided  that  the  plug  is  under  the\nexclusive  control  of  the  employee  performing  the  servicing  and  mainte‐\nnance for the duration of the work.\nN360.6 Grounding  Sticks.  Grounding  sticks  shall  be  provided\nfor  qualified  persons  to  safely  discharge  any  residual  stored\nenergy contained in capacitors or to hold the capacitor poten‐\ntial at 0 volts. The grounding sticks shall be designed, construc‐\nted, installed, and periodically inspected so that the full energy\nand voltage of the capacitors can be safely discharged.\nN(A) Visual   Inspection.  The   ground   stick   shall   be   visually\ninspected  for  defects  before  each  use.  All  mechanical  connec‐\ntions  shall  be  examined  for  loose  connections.  Resistors  shall\nbe visually inspected for cracks or other defects and electrically\ntested for proper resistance. The following shall occur if defects\nor contamination are found:\n(1)If any defect or contamination that could adversely affect\nthe  insulating  qualities  or  mechanical  integrity  of  the\nground  stick  is  present,  the  tool  shall  be  removed  from\nservice.\n(2)If  the  defect  or  contamination  exists  on  the  grounding\nstick,  then  it  shall  be  replaced  or  repaired  and  tested\nbefore returning to service.\n(3)If the defect or contamination exists on the cable, then it\nshall be replaced or repaired and tested before returning\nto service.\nN(B) Electrical  Testing.  All  ground  sticks  shall  be  electrically\ntested as follows:\n(1)The  ground  stick  cable  shall  be  tested  to  verify  that  the\nimpedance is less than 0.1 ohms to ground every 2 years.\n(2)The testing shall be documented.\nException: The test shall be performed annually if the ground stick is\nutilized outdoors or in other adverse conditions.\n(3)Soft grounding (High-Z) ground sticks with resistors shall\nbe measured and compared to the specified value before\neach use.\nN(C) Storage and Disposal.  Any residual charge from capacitors\nshall be removed by discharging before servicing or removal.\n(1)All  uninstalled  capacitors  capable  of  storing  10  joules  or\ngreater at their rated voltage shall be short-circuited with\na conductor of appropriate size.\n(2)When  an  uninstalled  capacitor  is  discovered  without  the\nshorting  conductor  attached  to  the  terminals,  it  shall  be\ntreated  as  energized  and  charged  to  its  full  rated  voltage\nuntil determined safe by a qualified person.\nInformational Note: A capacitor that develops an internal open\ncircuit  could  retain  substantial  charge  internally  even  though\nthe   terminals   are   short-circuited.   Such   a   capacitor   can   be\nhazardous  to  transport,  because  the  damaged  internal  wiring\ncould reconnect and discharge the capacitor through the short-\ncircuiting  conductor.  Any  capacitor  that  shows  a  significant\nchange  in  capacitance  after  a  fault  could  have  this  problem.\nAction  should  be  taken  to  reduce  the  risk  associated  with  this\nhazard when it is discovered.\nCopyright National Fire Protection Association \nProvided by IHS Markit under license with NFPA\n\n\nINFORMATIVE ANNEX A\n70E–56\nShaded text = Revisions.

Observing   a   safe   approach\ndistance   from   exposed   energized   electrical   conductors   or\ncircuit  parts  is  an  effective  means  of  maintaining  electrical\nsafety. As the distance between a person and the exposed ener‐\ngized  conductors  or  circuit  parts  decreases,  the  potential  for\nelectrical incident increases.\nC.1.1 Unqualified  Persons,  Safe  Approach  Distance.  Unquali‐\nfied  persons  are  safe  when  they  maintain  a  distance  from  the\nexposed  energized  conductors  or  circuit  parts,  including  the\nlongest  conductive  object  being  handled,  so  that  they  cannot\ncontact  or  enter  a  specified  air  insulation  distance  to  the\nexposed  energized  electrical  conductors  or  circuit  parts.  This\nsafe   approach   distance   is   the   limited   approach   boundary.\nFurther,  persons  must  not  cross  the  arc  flash  boundary  unless\nthey  are  wearing  appropriate  personal  protective  clothing  and\nare  under  the  close  supervision  of  a  qualified  person.  Only\nwhen  continuously  escorted  by  a  qualified  person  should  an\nunqualified   person   cross   the   limited   approach   boundary.\nUnder no circumstance should an unqualified person cross the\nrestricted  approach  boundary,  where  special  shock  protection\ntechniques and equipment are required.\nC.1.2 Qualified Persons, Safe Approach Distance.\nC.1.2.1  Determine the arc flash boundary and, if the boundary\nis  to  be  crossed,  appropriate  arc-rated  protective  equipment\nmust be utilized.\nC.1.2.2  For  a  person  to  cross  the  limited  approach  boundary\nand  enter  the  limited  space,  a  person  should  meet  the  follow‐\ning criteria:\n(1)Be qualified to perform the job/task\n(2)Be  able  to  identify  the  hazards  and  associated  risks  with\nthe tasks to be performed\nC.1.2.3  To  cross  the  restricted  approach  boundary  and  enter\nthe  restricted  space,  qualified  persons  should  meet  the  follow‐\ning criteria:\n(1)As  applicable,  have  an  energized  electrical  work  permit\nauthorized by management.\n(2)Use personal protective equipment (PPE) that is rated for\nthe voltage and energy level involved.\n(3)Minimize  the  likelihood  of  bodily  contact  with  exposed\nenergized  conductors  and  circuit  parts  from  inadvertent\nmovement  by  keeping  as  much  of  the  body  out  of  the\nrestricted space as possible and using only protected body\nparts in the space as necessary to accomplish the work.\n(4)Use insulated tools and equipment.\n(See Figure C.1.2.3.)\nC.2 Basis   for   Distance   Values   in   Tables   130.4(E)(a)   and\n130.4(E)(b).\nC.2.1 General   Statement.  Columns   2   through   5   of   Table\n130.4(E)(a)   and   Table   130.4(E)(b)   show   various   distances\nfrom  the  exposed  energized  electrical  conductors  or  circuit\nparts. They include dimensions that are added to a basic mini‐\nmum  air  insulation  distance.  Those  basic  minimum  air  insula‐\ntion  distances  for  voltages  72.5  kV  and  under  are  based  on\nIEEE  4,  Standard  Techniques  for  High  Voltage  Testing,  Appendix\n2B; and voltages over 72.5 kV are based on IEEE 516, Guide for\nMaintenance Methods on Energized Power Lines. The minimum air\ninsulation  distances  that  are  required  to  avoid  flashover  are  as\nfollows:\n(1)≤300 V: 1 mm (0 ft 0.03 in.)\n(2)>300 V to ≤750 V: 2 mm (0 ft 0.07 in.)\n(3)>750 V to ≤2 kV: 5 mm (0 ft 0.19 in.)\n(4)>2 kV to ≤15 kV: 39 mm (0 ft 1.5 in.)\n(5)>15 kV to ≤36 kV: 161 mm (0 ft 6.3 in.)\n(6)>36 kV to ≤48.3 kV: 254 mm (0 ft 10.0 in.)\n(7)>48.3 kV to ≤72.5 kV: 381 mm (1 ft 3.0 in.)\n(8)>72.5 kV to ≤121 kV: 640 mm (2 ft 1.2 in.)\n(9)>138 kV to ≤145 kV: 778 mm (2 ft 6.6 in.)\n(10)>161 kV to ≤169 kV: 915 mm (3 ft 0.0 in.)\n(11)>230 kV to ≤242 kV: 1.281 m (4 ft 2.4 in.)\n(12)>345 kV to ≤362 kV: 2.282 m (7 ft 5.8 in.)\n(13)>500 kV to ≤550 kV: 3.112 m (10 ft 2.5 in.)\n(14)>765 kV to ≤800 kV: 4.225 m (13 ft 10.3 in.)\nC.2.1.1 Column  1.

Informative  Annex  D  summarizes  calcula‐\ntion  methods  available  for  calculating  arc  flash  boundary  and\nincident energy. It is important to investigate the limitations of\nany  methods  to  be  used.  The  limitations  of  methods  summar‐\nized in Informative Annex D are described in Table D.1.\nD.2  Ralph Lee Calculation Method.\nΔD.2.1 Basic  Equations  for  Calculating  Arc  Flash  Boundary\nDistances.  The  short-circuit  symmetrical  ampacity,  I\nsc\n,  from  a\nbolted three-phase fault at the transformer terminals is calcula‐\nted with the following formula:\nIMVAVZ\nsc\n=×÷××÷ % Base    101 732100\n6\n\n\n\n\n[]\n{}\n{}\n.\nwhere I\nsc\n is in amperes, V is in volts, and %Z is based on the\ntransformer MVA.\nA  typical  value  for  the  maximum  power,  P  (in  MW)  in  a\nthree-phase arc can be calculated using the following formula:\nPMVA\nbf\n=×maximum bolted fault, in \n\n\n\n\n0 707\n2\n.\nPV   I\nsc\n=××××\n−\n1 73210   0 707\n62\n..\nThe arc flash boundary distance is calculated in accordance\nwith the following formulae:\nDMVAt\ncbf\n=××2 65\n1\n2\n.\n\n\n\n\n \n[D.2.1a]\n \n[D.2.1b]\n \n[D.2.1c]\n \n[D.2.1d]N\nDMVA    t\nc\n=××53\n1\n2\n[]\nwhere:\nD\nc\n=distance in feet of person from arc source for a just\ncurable burn (that is, skin temperature remains less\nthan 80°C).\nMVA\nbf\n=\nbolted fault MVA at point involved.\nMVA\n=MVA rating of transformer. For transformers with MVA\nratings below 0.75 MVA, multiply the transformer MVA\nrating by 1.25.\nt\n=time of arc exposure in seconds.\nThe  clearing  time  for  a  current-limiting  fuse  is  approxi‐\nmately  \n1\n∕\n4\n  cycle  or  0.004  second  if  the  arcing  fault  current  is  in\nthe  fuse’s  current-limiting  range.  The  clearing  time  of  a  5-kV\nand  15-kV  circuit  breaker  is  approximately  0.1  second  or  6\ncycles  if  the  instantaneous  function  is  installed  and  operating.\nThis  can  be  broken  down  as  follows:  actual  breaker  time\n(approximately 2 cycles), plus relay operating time of approxi‐\nmately 1.74 cycles, plus an additional safety margin of 2 cycles,\ngiving  a  total  time  of  approximately  6  cycles.  Additional  time\nmust be added if a time delay function is installed and operat‐\ning.\nThe  formulas  used  in  this  explanation  are  from  Ralph  Lee,\n“The  Other  Electrical  Hazard:  Electrical  Arc  Flash  Burns,”  in\nIEEE  Trans.

This  section  provides  a  summary  of  the\nscope  and  purpose  of  IEEE  1584-2018,  Guide  for  Performing  Arc\nFlash Hazard Calculations, and it also provides an overview of the\nmodel range of parameters. Readers are encouraged to consult\nIEEE  1584-2018  for  further  information  and  detailed  guide‐\nlines for proper application of the standard.\nIEEE 1584-2018 is a revision of IEEE 1584-2002 as amended\nby IEEE 1584a-2004 and IEEE 1584b-2011.\nThe  scope  and  purpose  of  IEEE  1584-2018  are  in  D.4.2  and\nD.4.3.\nND.4.2  Scope.  This  guide  provides  models  and  an  analytical\nprocess to enable calculation of the predicted incident thermal\nenergy and the arc-flash boundary (AFB). The process covers a\ncollection  of  applicable  field  data,  consideration  of  power\nsystem  operating  scenarios,  and  calculation  parameters.  Appli‐\ncations include electrical equipment and conductors for three-\nphase alternating current (ac) voltages from 208 volts to 15 kV.\nCalculations for single-phase ac systems and direct current (dc)\nsystems  are  not  a  part  of  this  guide,  but  some  guidance  and\nreferences  are  provided  for  those  applications.  Recommenda‐\ntions  for  personal  protective  equipment  (PPE)  to  mitigate  arc-\nflash hazards are not included in this guide.\nND.4.3  Purpose.  The  purpose  of  the  guide  is  to  enable  quali‐\nfied  person(s)  to  analyze  power  systems  for  the  purpose  of\ncalculating the incident energy (IE) to which employees could\nbe exposed during operations and maintenance work. Contrac‐\ntors  and  facility  owners  can  use  this  information  to  provide\nappropriate  protection  for  employees  in  accordance  with  the\nrequirements  of  applicable  electrical  workplace  safety  stand‐\nards.\n \n[D.3.3b]\nCopyright National Fire Protection Association \nProvided by IHS Markit under license with NFPA\n\n\nINFORMATIVE ANNEX D\n70E–66\nShaded text = Revisions.

The  orientation  and  arrange‐\nment  of  the  electrodes  used  in  the  testing  performed  for  the\nmodel development.\nThe  following  electrode  configurations  (test  arrangements)\nin  Table  D.4.6  are  defined  and  utilized  in  the  incident  energy\nmodel:\n(1)VCB:  Vertical  conductors/electrodes  inside  a  metal  box/\nenclosure\n(2)VCBB:  Vertical  conductors/electrodes  terminated  in  an\ninsulating barrier inside a metal box/enclosure\n(3)HCB:  Horizontal  conductors/electrodes  inside  a  metal\nbox/enclosure\n(4)VOA: Vertical conductors/electrodes in open air\n(5)HOA: Horizontal conductors/electrodes in open air\nN\nTable D.4.4  Range of Input Parameters for IEEE 1584-2018\nInput parameterRange\nVoltage (Voc)208 volts to 15,000 volts 3-phase \n(line-to-line)\nBolted fault current (I\nbf\n): \n208 volts to 600 volts — low \nvoltage (LV)\n500 amperes to 106 000 amperes \n(rms symmetrical)\nBolted fault current (I\nbf\n): \n601 volts to 15,000 volts — \nmedium voltage (MV)\n200 to 65 000 A \n(rms symmetrical)\nGap (G): 208 volts to 600 volts6.35 mm to 76.2 mm \n(0.25 in. to 3 in.)\nGap (G): 601 volts to \n15,000 volts\n19.05 mm to 254 mm \n(0.75 in. to 10 in.)\nWorking distance (D)≥ 305 mm (12 in.)\nFault clearing time (T)No limit\nMaximum height1244.6 mm (49 in.)\nMaximum width1244.6 mm (49 in.)\nMinimum widthFour times the gap mm (4 × G)\nOpening area1.549 m\n2\n (2401 in.\n2\n)\nFrequency50 Hz or 60 Hz\nND.4.7 Enclosure Size Correction Factor.

As  an  IEEE  guide,  this  docu‐\nment  suggests  approaches  for  conducting  an  arc-flash  hazard\nanalysis but does not contain any mandatory requirements that\npreclude  alternate  methods.  Following  the  suggestions  in  this\nguide  does  not  guarantee  safety,  and  users  should  take  all\nreasonable,  independent  steps  necessary  to  reduce  risks  from\narc-flash events.\nThis  information  is  offered  as  a  tool  for  conducting  an  arc-\nflash  hazard  analysis.  It  is  intended  for  use  only  by  qualified\npersons  who  are  knowledgeable  about  power  system  studies,\npower   distribution   equipment,   and   equipment   installation\npractices. It is not intended as a substitute for the engineering\njudgment and adequate review necessary for such studies.\nThis guide is based upon testing and analysis of the thermal\nburn hazard presented by incident energy. Due to the explosive\nnature  of  arc-flash  incidents,  injuries  can  occur  from  ensuing\nmolten metal splatters, projectiles, pressure waves, toxic arc by-\nproducts,  the  bright  light  of  the  arc,  and  the  loud  noise\nproduced. These other effects are not considered in this guide.\nThis guide is subject to revision as additional knowledge and\nexperience  is  gained.  IEEE,  those  companies  that  contributed\ntest data, and those people who worked on the development of\nthis standard make no guarantee of results and assume no obli‐\ngation  or  liability  whatsoever  in  connection  with  this  informa‐\ntion.\nThe methodology in this guide assumes that all equipment is\ninstalled,  operated,  and  maintained  as  required  by  applicable\ncodes, standards, and manufacturers’ instructions, and applied\nin  accordance  with  its  ratings.  Equipment  that  is  improperly\ninstalled  or  maintained  may  not  operate  correctly,  possibly\nincreasing  the  arc  flash  incident  energy  or  creating  other\nhazards.\n•\nN\nTable D.4.6  Electrode Orientation and Configurations\nE.C.StandardOrientationConfigurationTermination\nVOA2002/2018VerticalOpen airOpen air\nVCB2002/2018VerticalMetal \nenclosure\nOpen air\nVCBB2018VerticalMetal \nenclosure\nInsulating \nbarrier\nHOA2018HorizontalOpen airOpen air\nHCB2018HorizontalMetal \nenclosure\nOpen air\nCopyright National Fire Protection Association \nProvided by IHS Markit under license with NFPA\n\n\nINFORMATIVE ANNEX D\nShaded text = Revisions.

The following method of esti‐\nmating  dc  arc  flash  incident  energy  that  follows  was  published\nin the IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications (see reference 2 of\nD.5.2). This method is based on the concept that the maximum\npower possible in a dc arc will occur when the arcing voltage is\none-half the system voltage. Testing completed for Bruce Power\n(see reference 3 of D.5.3) has shown that this calculation is conser‐\nvatively  high  in  estimating  the  arc  flash  value.  This  method\napplies to dc systems rated up to 1000 \nvolts.\nII\nIEVIT    D\narcbf\nmsysarcarc\n=×\n=×××\n0 5\n0 01\n2\n.\n.\nwhere:\nI\narc\n=\narcing current, amperes\nI\nbf\n=\nsystem bolted fault current, amperes\nIE\nm\n=estimated dc arc flash incident energy at the maximum\npower point, cal/cm\n2\nV\nsys\n=\nsystem voltage, volts\nT\narc\n=\narcing time, sec\nD\n=working distance, cm\nFor  exposures  where  the  arc  is  in  a  box  or  enclosure,  it\nwould   be   prudent   to   consider   additional   PPE   protection\nbeyond the values shown in Table 130.7(C)(15)(b).\nD.5.2 Detailed    Arcing    Current    and    Energy    Calculations\nMethod.

The   determination   of   short\ncircuit current is necessary in order to use Table 130.7(C)(15)\n(b).  The  arcing  current  is  calculated  at  50  percent  of  the  dc\nshort-circuit   value.   The   current   that   a   battery   will   deliver\ndepends  on  the  total  impedance  of  the  short-circuit  path.  A\nconservative approach in determining the short-circuit current\nthat the battery will deliver at 25°C is to assume that the maxi‐\nmum  available  short-circuit  current  is  10  times  the  1  minute\nampere  rating  (to  1.75  volts  per  cell  at  25°C  and  the  specific\ngravity  of  1.215)  of  the  battery.  A  more  accurate  value  for  the\nshort-circuit   current   for   the   specific   application   can   be\nobtained from the battery manufacturer.\nReferences:\n1.

Risk management is the\nlogical,  systematic  process  used  to  manage  the  risk  associated\nwith any activity, process, function, or product including safety,\nthe  environment,  quality,  and  finance.  The  risk  management\nprocess and principles can be used by organizations of any type\nor size.\nThe  following  risk  management  principles  can  readily  be\napplied to electrical safety. Risk management:\n(1)Is  an  integral  part  of  all  organizational  processes  and\ndecision making\n(2)Is systematic, structured, and timely\n(3)Is based on the best available information\n(4)Takes human and cultural factors into account\n(5)Is dynamic, iterative, and responsive to change\n(6)Facilitates continual improvement of the organization\nInformational Note: For more information on risk management\nprinciples see ISO 31000:2009, Risk Management — Principles and\nGuidelines.\nThe risk management process includes the following:\n(1)Communication and consultation\n(2)Establishing the risk assessment context and objectives\n(3)Risk assessment\n(4)Risk treatment\n(5)Recording  and  reporting  the  risk  assessment  results  and\nrisk treatment decisions\n(6)Monitoring and reviewing risks\nRisk assessment is the part of risk management that involves\nthe following:\n(1)Identifying sources of risk\n(2)Analyzing the sources of risk to estimate a level of risk\n(3)Evaluating the level of risk to determine if risk treatment\nis required\n(See Figure F.1.)\nF.1.1 Occupational  Health  and  Safety  (OHS)  Risk  Manage‐\nment.  The same logical, systematic process and the same prin‐\nciples apply to risk management in the OHS sphere of activity.\nHowever,   it   is   more   focused   and   the   terminology   more\nnarrowly defined, as follows:\n(1)The  OHS  objective  is  freedom  from  harm  (i.e.,  injury  or\ndamage to health).\n(2)Sources of risk are referred to as hazards.\n(3)Analyzing  and  estimating  the  level  of  risk  is  a  combina‐\ntion of the estimation of the likelihood of the occurrence\nof harm and the severity of that harm.\n(4)The level of risk is evaluated to determine if it is reasona‐\nble to conclude that freedom from harm can be achieved\nor if further risk treatment is required.\n(5)Risk treatment is referred to as risk control.\nTherefore, OHS risk assessment involves the following:\n(1)Hazard identification: Find, list, and characterize hazards.\n(2)Risk analysis: Sources, causes, and potential consequences\nare analyzed to determine the following:\na.The likelihood that harm might result\nb.The potential severity of that harm\nc.Estimate the level of risk\n(3)Risk  evaluation:  The  level  of  risk  is  evaluated  to  deter‐\nmine if the objective of freedom from harm can reasona‐\nbly be met by the risk control that is in place or is further\nrisk control required?\nF.2 Relationship  to  Occupational  Health  and  Safety  Manage‐\nment  System  (OHSMS).  As  discussed  in  Annex  P,  the  most\neffective  application  of  the  requirements  of  this  standard  can\nbe  achieved  within  the  framework  of  an  OHSMS.  Using  a\nmanagement system provides a methodical approach to health\nand safety by means of goal setting, planning, and performance\nmeasurement.\nRisk management shares the six management system process\nelements of the following:\n(1)Leadership.  If  any  venture  is  to  succeed  it  needs  to  be\nsponsored at the highest levels of the organization.\n(2)Policy.  The  organization  should  articulate  its  vision  and\nestablish relevant, attainable goals.\n(3)Plan.  A  plan  is  developed  in  line  with  the  organization’s\nvision  and  to  achieve  its  goals.  The  plan  must  include\nmechanisms  to  measure  and  monitor  the  success  of  the\nplan.\nEstablishing the context\nMonitor\nand\nreview\nHazard identification\nRisk analysis\nRisk evaluation\nRisk control\nRisk assessment\nFIGURE  F.1     Risk Management Process (Adapted from ISO\n31000 figure 3).\nCopyright National Fire Protection Association \nProvided by IHS Markit under license with NFPA\n\n\nINFORMATIVE ANNEX F\n70E–70\nShaded text = Revisions. Δ = Text deletions and figure/table revisions.    • = Section deletions. N = New material.\n(4)Do. The plan is executed.\n(5)Check  (Monitor).  The  success  of  the  plan  in  achieving\nthe organization’s goals is continuously monitored.\n(6)Act  (Review).  The  measuring  and  monitoring  results  are\ncompared to the organization’s goals for the purposes of\nreviewing   and   revising   goals   and   plans   to   improve\nperformance.\nAs noted in F.1, risk management is iterative. The repeating\nnature  of  the  management  system  plan-do-check-act  (PDCA)\ncycle   is   intended   to   promote   continuous   improvement   in\nhealth and safety performance.\nRisk  assessment  fits  into  the  “plan”  and  “do”  stages  of  the\nPDCA cycle, as follows:\n(1)Planning:  Information  used  during  the  planning  stage\ncomes  from  sources  that  can  include  workplace  inspec‐\ntions, incident reports, and risk assessments.\n(2)Do: Risk assessment is an ongoing activity.\nF.3 Hierarchy  of  Risk  Control.  The  purpose  of  specifying  and\nadhering  to  a  hierarchy  of  risk  control  methods  is  to  identify\nthe  most  effective  individual  or  combination  of  preventive  or\nprotective measures to reduce the risk associated with a hazard.\nEach  risk  control  method  is  considered  less  effective  than  the\none before it. Table F.3 lists the hierarchy of risk control identi‐\nfied in this and other safety standards and provides examples of\neach.\nF.4 Hazard-Based   Risk   Assessment.  In   a   hazard-based   risk\nassessment, workplace hazards are identified and characterized\nfor  materials,  processes,  the  worksite,  and  the  environment.\nActivities that might be affected by those hazards are identified.\nThe risk associated with each activity is analyzed for likelihood\nTable F.3  The Hierarchy of Risk Control Methods\nRisk Control MethodExamples"

An  organization  uses  this  infor‐\nmation to prioritize risk reduction decisions.\nThe information from hazard-based risk assessments is useful\nto  organizations  when  designing,  specifying,  and  purchasing\nelectrical  distribution  equipment.  Risk  control  is  much  more\neffective  when  it  is  applied  at  the  beginning  of  the  equipment\nor process lifecycle. Risk can be reduced by specifying “substitu‐\ntion”  and  “engineering”  risk  control  methods  that  affect  the\nlikelihood of occurrence of harm or severity of harm.\nF.5 Task-Based  Risk  Assessment.  In  a  task-based  risk  assess‐\nment,  a  job  is  broken  down  into  discrete  tasks.  Hazards  are\nidentified for each task (often referred to as task-hazard pairs).\nThe risk associated with each hazard is analyzed and evaluated.\nThe  task-based  risk  assessment  is  the  most  commonly  used\nwhen performing a field level risk assessment.\nF.6 Risk Assessment Methods.  There are many risk assessment\nmethods.  The  method  or  combination  of  methods  should  be\nchosen based on the following:\n(1)The application\n(2)The desired result\n(3)The skill level of the persons performing the assessment\nSome risk assessment methods include the following:\n(1)Brainstorming.   An   open   group   discussion   regarding\nhazards, the associated risk, and risk control methods can\nbe  used  as  part  of  pre-job  planning  and  during  a  job\nbriefing session.\n(2)Checklists. A list of common hazards and possible control\nmethods is a useful tool for pre-job planning and for job\nbriefing  purposes.  See  Annex  I  for  an  example  of  a  job\nbriefing and planning checklist.\n(3)Risk   assessment   matrix.   A   risk   assessment   matrix   is\ncommonly used to quantify levels of risk. The matrix can\nbe  in  a  multilevel  or  a  simple  two-by-two  format.  See\nFigure F.6 for an example of a risk assessment matrix.\nInformational  Note:  See  ISO  31010,  Risk  management  —  Risk\nassessment  techniques,  and  ANSI/AIHA  Z10-2012,  Occupational\nHealth  and  Safety  Management  Systems,  for  further  information\nregarding risk assessment methods.\nNF.7 Battery Risk Assessment.  Multiple hazards may be encoun‐\ntered  when  working  on  batteries  (shock,  arc  flash,  chemical,\nthermal).  PPE  selection  should  take  into  account  all  of  the\nhazards  depending  on  the  task.  The  flow  chart  displayed  in\nFigure  F.7  will  assist  users  to  assess  all  hazards  associated  with\nwork on batteries.\nCopyright National Fire Protection Association \nProvided by IHS Markit under license with NFPA\n\n\nINFORMATIVE ANNEX F\nShaded text = Revisions.

Tagout  is  an  alternative\nmethod  that  is  available  to  employers.  The  sample  program\nand  procedures  that  follow  are  provided  to  assist  employers  in\ndeveloping  a  lockout/tagout  program  and  procedures  that\nmeet the requirements of Article 120 of NFPA 70E.The sample\nprogram  and  procedures  can  be  used  for  a  simple  lockout/\ntagout or as part of a complex lockout/tagout. A more compre‐\nhensive  procedure  will  need  to  be  developed,  documented,\nand used for the complex lockout/tagout.\nLOCKOUT/TAGOUT PROGRAM\nFOR [COMPANY NAME]\nOR\nTAGOUT PROGRAM FOR [COMPANY NAME]\n1.0  Purpose.  This    procedure    establishes    the    minimum\nrequirements  for  lockout  /tagout  of  electrical  energy  sources.\nIt is to be used to ensure that conductors and circuit parts are\ndisconnected    from    sources    of    electrical    energy,    locked\n(tagged),  and  tested  before  work  begins  where  employees\ncould  be  exposed  to  dangerous  conditions.  Sources  of  stored\nenergy,  such  as  capacitors  or  springs,  shall  be  relieved  of  their\nenergy, and a mechanism shall be engaged to prevent the reac‐\ncumulation of energy.\n2.0  Responsibility.  All  employees  shall  be  instructed  in  the\nsafety significance of the lockout/tagout procedure. All new or\ntransferred employees and all other persons whose work opera‐\ntions  are  or  might  be  in  the  area  shall  be  instructed  in  the\npurpose and use of this procedure. [Name(s) of the person(s) or the\njob  title(s)  of  the  employee(s)  with  responsibility]  shall  ensure  that\nappropriate  personnel  receive  instructions  on  their  roles  and\nresponsibilities.  All  persons  installing  a  lockout/tagout  device\nshall  sign  their  names  and  the  date  on  the  tag  [or  state  how  the\nname of the individual or person in charge will be available].\n3.0  Preparation for Lockout/Tagout.\n3.1  Review  current  diagrammatic  drawings  (or  their  equiva‐\nlent),  tags,  labels,  and  signs  to  identify  and  locate  all  discon‐\nnecting  means  to  determine  that  power  is  interrupted  by  a\nphysical  break  and  not  de-energized  by  a  circuit  interlock.\nMake a list of disconnecting means to be locked (tagged).\n3.2  Review  disconnecting  means  to  determine  adequacy  of\ntheir  interrupting  ability.  Determine  if  it  will  be  possible  to\nverify a visible open point, or if other precautions will be neces‐\nsary.\n3.3  Review other work activity to identify where and how other\npersonnel might be exposed to electrical hazards. Review other\nenergy  sources  in  the  physical  area  to  determine  employee\nexposure  to  those  sources  of  other  types  of  energy.  Establish\nenergy control methods for control of other hazardous energy\nsources in the area.\n3.4  Provide  an  adequately  rated  test  instrument  to  test  each\nphase  conductor  or  circuit  part  to  verify  that  they  are  de-\nenergized  (see  Section  G.11.3).  Provide  a  method  to  determine\nthat the test instrument is operating satisfactorily.\n3.5  Where the possibility of induced voltages or stored electri‐\ncal  energy  exists,  call  for  grounding  the  phase  conductors  or\ncircuit parts before touching them. Where it could be reasona‐\nbly  anticipated  that  contact  with  other  exposed  energized\nconductors or circuit parts is possible, call for applying ground\nconnecting devices.\n4.0 Simple     Lockout/Tagout.  The     simple     lockout/tagout\nprocedure  will  involve  G.1.0  through  G.3.0,  G.5.0  through\nG.9.0, and G.11.0 through G.13.0.\n5.0  Sequence of Lockout/Tagout System Procedures.\n5.1  The  employees  shall  be  notified  that  a  lockout/tagout\nsystem  is  going  to  be  implemented  and  the  reason  for  it.  The\nqualified   employee   implementing   the   lockout/tagout   shall\nknow  the  disconnecting  means  location  for  all  sources  of  elec‐\ntrical  energy  and  the  location  of  all  sources  of  stored  energy.\nThe qualified person shall be knowledgeable of hazards associ‐\nated with electrical energy.\n5.2  If  the  electrical  supply  is  energized,  the  qualified  person\nshall de-energize and disconnect the electric supply and relieve\nall stored energy.\n5.3  Wherever  possible,  the  blades  of  disconnecting  devices\nshould be visually verified to be fully opened, or draw-out type\ncircuit breakers should be verified to be completely withdrawn\nto the fully disconnected position.\n5.4  Lockout/tagout  all  disconnecting  means  with  lockout/\ntagout devices.\nInformational  Note:  For  tagout,  one  additional  safety  measure\nmust  be  employed,  such  as  opening,  blocking,  or  removing  an\nadditional circuit element.\n5.5  Attempt to operate the disconnecting means to determine\nthat operation is prohibited.\n5.6  A  test  instrument  shall  be  used.  (See  G.11.3.)  Inspect  the\ninstrument  for  visible  damage.  Do  not  proceed  if  there  is  an\nindication  of  damage  to  the  instrument  until  an  undamaged\ndevice is available.\n5.7  Verify  proper  instrument  operation  on  a  known  source  of\nvoltage and then test for absence of voltage.\n5.8  Verify  proper  instrument  operation  on  a  known  source  of\nvoltage after testing for absence of voltage.\n5.9  Where  required,  install  a  grounding  equipment/conduc‐\ntor  device  on  the  phase  conductors  or  circuit  parts,  to  elimi‐\nnate  induced  voltage  or  stored  energy,  before  touching  them.\nWhere it has been determined that contact with other exposed\nenergized conductors or circuit parts is possible, apply ground\nconnecting devices rated for the available fault duty.\nCopyright National Fire Protection Association \nProvided by IHS Markit under license with NFPA\n\n\nINFORMATIVE ANNEX G\nShaded text = Revisions.

For a simple\nlockout/tagout and where more than one person is involved in\nthe  job  or  task,  each  person  shall  install  his  or  her  own\npersonal lockout/tagout device.\n8.0 Procedure  Involving  More  Than  One  Shift.  When  the\nlockout/tagout extends for more than one day, it shall be veri‐\nfied that the lockout/tagout is still in place at the beginning of\nthe next day. When the lockout/tagout is continued on succes‐\nsive  shifts,  the  lockout/tagout  is  considered  to  be  a  complex\nlockout/tagout.\nFor  a  complex  lockout/tagout,  the  person  in  charge  shall\nidentify  the  method  for  transfer  of  the  lockout/tagout  and  of\ncommunication with all employees.\n9.0 Complex    Lockout/Tagout.  A    complex    lockout/tagout\nplan is required where one or more of the following exist:\n(1)Multiple energy sources (more than one)\n(2)Multiple crews\n(3)Multiple crafts\n(4)Multiple locations\n(5)Multiple employers\n(6)Unique disconnecting means\n(7)Complex or particular switching sequences\n(8)Lockout/tagout for more than one shift; that is, new shift\nworkers\n9.1  All  complex  lockout/tagout  procedures  shall  require  a\nwritten  plan  of  execution.  The  plan  shall  include  the  require‐\nments  in  G.1.0  through  G.3.0,  G.5.0,  G.6.0,  and  G.8.0  through\nG.12.0.\n9.2  A  person  in  charge  shall  be  involved  with  a  complex  lock‐\nout/tagout  procedure.  The  person  in  charge  shall  be  at  the\nprocedure location.\n9.3  The person in charge shall develop a written plan of execu‐\ntion and communicate that plan to all persons engaged in the\njob or task. The person in charge shall be held accountable for\nsafe   execution   of   the   complex   lockout/tagout   plan.   The\ncomplex lockout/tagout plan must address all the concerns of\nemployees  who  might  be  exposed,  and  they  must  understand\nhow electrical energy is controlled. The person in charge shall\nensure  that  each  person  understands  the  electrical  hazards  to\nwhich  they  are  exposed  and  the  safety-related  work  practices\nthey are to use.\n9.4  All  complex  lockout/tagout  plans  identify  the  method  to\naccount  for  all  persons  who  might  be  exposed  to  electrical\nhazards in the course of the lockout/tagout.\nOne of the following methods is to be used:\n(1)Each individual shall install his or her own personal lock‐\nout or tagout device.\n(2)The person in charge shall lock his/her key in a lock box.\n(3)The  person  in  charge  shall  maintain  a  sign-in/sign-out\nlog for all personnel entering the area.\n(4)Another equally effective methodology shall be used.\n9.5  The  person  in  charge  can  install  locks/tags  or  direct  their\ninstallation on behalf of other employees.\n9.6  The person in charge can remove locks/tags or direct their\nremoval on behalf of other employees, only after all personnel\nare  accounted  for  and  ensured  to  be  clear  of  potential  electri‐\ncal hazards.\n9.7  Where the complex lockout/tagout is continued on succes‐\nsive  shifts,  the  person  in  charge  shall  identify  the  method  for\ntransfer of the lockout and the method of communication with\nall employees.\n10.0  Discipline.\n10.1  Knowingly violating the requirements of this program will\nresult in [state disciplinary actions that will be taken].\n10.2  Knowingly   operating   a   disconnecting   means   with   an\ninstalled lockout device (tagout device) will result in [state disci‐\nplinary actions to be taken].\n11.0  Equipment.\n11.1  Locks shall be [state type and model of selected locks].\n11.2  Tags shall be [state type and model to be used].\n11.3  The  test  instrument(s)  to  be  used  shall  be  [state  type  and\nmodel].\n12.0  Review.

Table\n130.5(C),  Table  130.7(C)(15)(a),  Table  130.7(C)(15)(b),  and\nTable  130.7(C)(15)(c)  provide  guidance  for  the  selection  and\nuse of PPE when using arc flash PPE categories.\nH.2 Simplified  Two-Category  Clothing  Approach  for  Use  with\nTable   130.7(C)(15)(a),   Table   130.7(C)(15)(b),   and   Table\n130.7(C)(15)(c).  The use of Table H.2 is a simplified approach\nto provide minimum PPE for electrical workers within facilities\nwith large and diverse electrical systems. The clothing listed in\nTable H.2 fulfills the minimum arc-rated clothing requirements\nof  Table  130.7(C)(15)(a),  Table  130.7(C)(15)(b),  and  Table\n130.7(C)(15)(c).   The   clothing   systems   listed   in   this   table\nshould be used with the other PPE appropriate for the arc flash\nPPE  category  [see  Table  130.7(C)(15)(c)].  The  notes  to  Table\n130.7(C)(15)(a),  Table  130.7(C)(15)(b),  and  Table  130.7(C)\n(15)(c) must apply as shown in those tables.\nH.3 Arc-Rated  Clothing  and  Other  Personal  Protective  Equip‐\nment   (PPE)   for   Use   with   Risk   Assessment   of   Electrical\nHazards.  Table  H.3  provides  a  summary  of  specific  sections\nwithin  the  NFPA  70E  standard  describing  PPE  for  electrical\nhazards.\nH.4 Conformity Assessment of Personal Protective Equipment\n(PPE).\nH.4.1  Introduction.  Section   130.7(C)(14)   requires   personal\nprotective  equipment  (PPE)  provided  by  a  supplier  or  manu‐\nfacturer to conform to appropriate product standards by one of\nthree  methods.  Additional  information  for  these  conformity\nassessment methods can be found within ANSI/ISEA 125, Amer‐\nican  National  Standard  for  Conformity  Assessment  of  Safety  and\nPersonal Protective Equipment. ANSI/ISEA 125 establishes criteria\nfor  conformity  assessment  of  safety  and  PPE  that  is  sold  with\nclaims  of  compliance  with  product  performance  standards.\nANSI/ISEA 125 contains provisions for data collection, product\nverification,    conformation    of    quality    and    manufacturing\nproduction control, and roles and responsibilities of suppliers,\ntesting  organizations,  and  third-party  certification  organiza‐\ntions.\nH.4.2 Level of Conformity.  ANSI/ISEA 125 provides for three\ndifferent levels of conformity assessment: Level 1, Level 2, and\nLevel 3.\nLevel  1  conformity  is  where  the  supplier  or  manufacturer  is\nmaking  a  self-declaration  that  a  product  meets  all  of  the\nrequirements   of   the   standard(s)   to   which   conformance   is\nclaimed.  A  supplier  Declaration  of  Conformity  for  each  prod‐\nuct  is  required  to  be  made  available  for  examination  upon\nrequest.\nLevel  2  conformity  is  where  the  supplier  or  manufacturer  is\nmaking  a  self-declaration  that  a  product  meets  all  of  the\nrequirements   of   the   standard(s)   to   which   conformance   is\nclaimed,   the   supplier   or   manufacturer   has   a   registered\nISO  9001  Quality  Management  System  or  equivalent  quality\nmanagement system, and all testing has been carried out by an\nISO 17025 accredited testing laboratory.

While  there  are  three  levels  of  conformity\nassessment  described  in  ANSI/ISEA  125,  the  levels  are  not  to\nbe considered as equivalent. Users are cautioned that the level\nof  rigor  required  to  demonstrate  conformity  should  be  based\non  the  potential  safety  and  health  consequence  of  using  a\nproduct  that  does  not  meet  a  stated  performance  standard.  A\nhigher potential safety and health consequence associated with\nthe use of a noncompliant product should necessitate a higher\nlevel of conformity assessment.\nH.4.4 Supplier’s  Declaration  of  Conformity.  A  Declaration  of\nConformity  should  be  issued  by  the  supplier  and  made  availa‐\nble  for  examination  upon  request  from  a  customer,  user,  or\nrelevant  authority.  The  Declaration  of  Conformity  should,  at  a\nminimum:\n(1)List the supplier name and address.\n(2)Include  a  product  model  number  or  other  identification\ndetails.\n(3)List   the   product   performance   standard   or   standards\n(designation and year) to which conformance is claimed.\n(4)Include a statement of attestation.\n(5)Be  dated,  written  on  supplier  letterhead,  and  signed  by\nan  authorized  representative.

N = New material.\n70E–83\nInformative Annex K   General Categories of Electrical Hazards\nThis informative annex is not a part of the requirements of this NFPA\ndocument but is included for informational purposes only.\nK.1  General.  Electrical  injuries  represent  a  serious  workplace\nhealth and safety issue to electrical and non-electrical workers.\nData  from  the  U.S.  Bureau  of  Labor  Statistics  (BLS)  indicate\nthat  there  were  nearly  6000  fatal  electrical  injuries  to  workers\nin  the  United  States  from  1992  through  2012.  BLS  data  also\nindicate  that  there  were  24,100  non-fatal  electrical  injuries\nfrom  2003  through  2012.  From  1992  to  2013,  the  number  of\nfatal   workplace   electrical   injuries   has   fallen   steadily   and\ndramatically  from  334  in  1992  to  139  in  2013.  However,  the\ntrend   with   non-fatal   electrical   injuries   is   less   consistent.\nBetween  2003  and  2009,  non-fatal  injury  totals  ranged  from\n2390  in  2003  to  2620  in  2009,  with  a  high  of  2950  injuries  in\n2005.  Non-fatal  injury  totals  between  2010  through  2012  were\nthe lowest over this 10-year period, with 1890 non-fatal injuries\nin 2010, 2250 in 2011, and 1700 in 2012.\nThere are two general categories of electrical injury: electri‐\ncal  shock  and  electrical  burns.  Electrical  burns  can  be  further\nsubdivided  into  burns  caused  by  radiant  energy  (arc  burns),\nburns  caused  by  exposure  to  ejected  hot  gases  and  materials\n(thermal  burns),  and  burns  caused  by  the  conduction  of  elec‐\ntrical current through body parts (conduction burns). In addi‐\ntion,  hearing  damage  can  occur  from  acoustic  energy,  and\ntraumatic  injury  can  be  caused  by  toxic  gases  and  pressure\nwaves associated with an arcing event.\nAbout 98 percent of fatal occupational electrical injuries are\nelectrical shock injuries. A corporate case study examining elec‐\ntrical    injury    reporting    and    safety    practices    found    that\n40 percent of electrical incidents involved 250 volts or less and\nwere indicative of a misperception of electrical safety as a high-\nvoltage  issue.  In  addition,  electrical  incidents  once  again  were\nfound  to  involve  a  large  share  of  non-electrical  workers,  with\napproximately  one-half  of  incidents  involving  workers  from\noutside   electrical   crafts.   Research   of   electrical   fatalities   in\nconstruction  found  that  the  highest  proportion  of  fatalities\noccurred  in  establishments  with  10  or  fewer  employees  and\npointed  out  that  smaller  employers  could  have  fewer  formal\ntraining  requirements  and  less  structured  training  in  safety\npractices.\nK.2 Electric  Shock.  Over  40  percent  of  all  electrical  fatalities\nin the U.S. involved overhead power line contact. This includes\noverhead  power  line  fatalities  from  direct  contact  by  a  worker,\ncontact  through  hand-carried  objects,  and  contact  through\nmachines  and  vehicles.  Comparing  the  ratio  of  total  electrical\nfatalities  to  total  electrical  injuries  (fatal  and  nonfatal),  it  was\nnoticed  that  electrical  injuries  are  more  often  fatal  than  many\nother  injury  categories.  For  example,  from  2003  to  2009  there\nwere  20,033  electrical  injuries  of  which  1573  were  fatalities.\nOne  worker  died  for  every  12.74  electrical  injuries.  For  the\nsame  period  there  were  1,718,219  fall  injuries  of  which  5279\nwere fatalities — one worker died for every 325 injuries.\nOf those, 1573 were electrical fatalities. A more detailed look\nat the demographics for 168 electrical fatalities in 2009 showed\nthat 99 percent of deaths were the result of electrocution, and\n70   percent   occurred   while   the   worker   was   performing   a\nconstructing, repairing, or cleaning activity.\nK.3  Arc Flash.  In the recently issued 29 CFR Subpart V, OSHA\nidentified  99  injuries  that  involved  burns  from  arcs  from  ener‐\ngized equipment faults or failures, resulting in 21 fatalities and\n94  hospitalized  injuries  for  the  period  January  1991  through\nDecember 1998.\nBased  on  this  data,  OSHA  estimated  that  an  average  of  at\nleast  eight  burn  injuries  from  arcs  occur  each  year  involving\nemployees  doing  work  covered  by  OSHA  rules,  leading  to\n12  non-fatal  injuries  and  two  fatalities  per  year.  Of  the  reports\nindicating  the  extent  of  the  burn  injury,  75  percent  reported\nthird-degree burns.\nDuring  the  period  involved,  Federal  OSHA  only  required\nnon-fatal  injuries  to  be  reported  when  there  were  three  or\nmore  workers  hospitalized.  OSHA  found  that  there  were  six\ninjuries  for  every  fatality  in  California,  which  requires  the\nreporting of every hospitalized injury.\nUsing  that  data,  OSHA  estimated  that  would  be  at  least\n36  injuries  to  every  fatality,  and  probably  many  more.  Also,\nmany  non-fatal  electric  shocks  involve  burns  from  associated\nelectric arcs.\nStarting January 1, 2015, Federal OSHA requires every hospi‐\ntalized injury to be reported.\nK.4 Arc  Blast.  The  tremendous  temperatures  of  the  arc  cause\nthe  explosive  expansion  of  both  the  surrounding  air  and  the\nmetal in the arc path. For example, copper expands by a factor\nof  67,000  times  when  it  turns  from  a  solid  to  a  vapor.  The\ndanger associated with this expansion is one of high pressures,\nsound,  and  shrapnel.  The  high  pressures  can  easily  exceed\nhundreds or even thousands of pounds per square foot, knock‐\ning  workers  off  ladders,  rupturing  eardrums,  and  collapsing\nlungs.  Finally,  material  and  molten  metal  are  expelled  away\nfrom the arc at speeds exceeding 1120 km/hr (700 mph), fast\nenough for shrapnel to completely penetrate the human body.\nK.5 Other    Information.

This    informative    annex\npermits  a  typical  application  of  safeguards  in  electrolytic  areas\nwhere electrical hazards exist. Take, for example, an employee\nworking  on  an  energized  cell.  The  employee  uses  manual\ncontact  to  make  adjustments  and  repairs.  Consequently,  the\nexposed   energized   cell   and   grounded   metal   floor   could\npresent  an  electrical  hazard.  Safeguards  for  this  employee  can\nbe provided in the following ways:\n(1)Protective  boots  can  be  worn  that  isolate  the  employee’s\nfeet from the floor and that provide a safeguard from the\nelectrical hazard.\n(2)Protective gloves can be worn that isolate the employee’s\nhands  from  the  energized  cell  and  that  provide  a  safe‐\nguard.\n(3)If  the  work  task  causes  severe  deterioration,  wear,  or\ndamage  to  personal  protective  equipment  (PPE),  the\nemployee  might  have  to  wear  both  protective  gloves  and\nboots.\n(4)A  permanent  or  temporary  insulating  surface  can  be\nprovided  for  the  employee  to  stand  on  to  provide  a  safe‐\nguard.\n(5)The design of the installation can be modified to provide\na conductive surface for the employee to stand on. If the\nconductive surface is bonded to the cell, a safeguard will\nbe provided by voltage equalization.\n(6)Safe  work  practices  can  provide  safeguards.  If  protective\nboots  are  worn,  the  employee  should  not  make  long\nreaches over energized (or grounded) surfaces such that\nhis  or  her  elbow  bypasses  the  safeguard.  If  such  move‐\nments are required, protective sleeves, protective mats, or\nspecial  tools  should  be  used.  Training  on  the  nature  of\nelectrical  hazards  and  proper  use  and  condition  of  safe‐\nguards is, in itself, a safeguard.\n(7)The energized cell can be temporarily bonded to ground.\nL.2 Electrical  Power  Receptacles.  Power  supply  circuits  and\nreceptacles in the cell line area for portable electric equipment\nshould  meet  the  requirements  of  668.21  of  NFPA  70,  National\nElectrical Code. However, it is recommended that receptacles for\nportable electric equipment not be installed in electrolytic cell\nareas  and  that  only  pneumatic-powered  portable  tools  and\nequipment be used.\nCopyright National Fire Protection Association \nProvided by IHS Markit under license with NFPA\n\n\nINFORMATIVE ANNEX M\nShaded text = Revisions.

The  use  of\nall arc-rated clothing layers will result in achieving the required\narc rating with the lowest number of layers and lowest clothing\nsystem  weight.  Garments  that  are  not  arc  rated  should  not  be\nused  to  increase  the  arc  rating  of  a  garment  or  of  a  clothing\nsystem.\nM.1.2 A total system of protective clothing can be determined\nto  take  credit  for  the  protection  provided  by  all  the  layers  of\nclothing that are worn\n if tested as a combination. For example,\nto  achieve  an  arc  rating  of  40  cal/cm\n2\n  (167.5  J/cm\n2\n),  an  arc\nflash suit with an arc rating of 40 cal/cm\n2\n (167.5 J/cm\n2\n) could\nbe  worn  over  a  cotton  shirt  and  cotton  pants.  Alternatively,  an\narc flash suit with a 25 cal/cm\n2\n (104.7 J/cm\n2\n) arc rating could\nbe worn over an arc-rated shirt and arc-rated pants with an arc\nrating  of  8  cal/cm\n2\n  (33.5  J/cm\n2\n)  to  achieve  a  total  system  arc\nrating   of   40   cal/cm\n2\n   (167.5   J/cm\n2\n).   This   latter   approach\nprovides  the  required  arc  rating  at  a  lower  weight  and  with\nfewer  total  layers  of  fabric  and,  consequently,  would  provide\nthe required protection with a higher level of worker comfort.\nM.2 Layering  Using  Arc-Rated  Clothing  over  Natural  Fiber\nClothing Underlayers.\nM.2.1  Under  some  exposure  conditions,  natural  fiber  under‐\nlayers  can  ignite  even  when  they  are  worn  under  arc-rated\nclothing.\nM.2.2  If  the  arc  flash  exposure  is  sufficient  to  break  open  all\nthe  arc-rated  clothing  outerlayer  or  underlayers,  the  natural\nfiber underlayer can ignite and cause more severe burn injuries\nto  an  expanded  area  of  the  body.  This  is  due  to  the  natural\nfiber underlayers burning onto areas of the worker’s body that\nwere  not  exposed  by  the  arc  flash  event.  This  can  occur  when\nthe natural fiber underlayer continues to burn underneath arc-\nrated clothing layers even in areas in which the arc-rated cloth‐\ning  layer  or  layers  are  not  broken  open  due  to  a  “chimney\neffect.”\nM.3  Total System Arc Rating.\nM.3.1  The  total  system  arc  rating  is  the  arc  rating  obtained\nwhen all clothing layers worn by a worker are tested as a multi‐\nlayer  test  sample.  An  example  of  a  clothing  system  is  an  arc-\nrated  coverall  worn  over  an  arc-rated  shirt  and  arc-rated  pants\nin which all of the garments are constructed from the same arc-\nrated fabric. For this two-layer arc-rated clothing system, the arc\nrating  would  typically  be  more  than  three  times  higher  than\nthe arc ratings of the individual layers; that is, if the arc ratings\nof  the  arc-rated  coverall,  shirt,  and  pants  were  all  in  the  range\nof  5  cal/cm\n2\n  (20.9  J/cm\n2\n)  to  6  cal/cm\n2\n  (25.1  J/cm\n2\n),  the  total\ntwo-layer   system   arc   rating   would   be   over   20   cal/cm\n2\n(83.7 J/cm\n2\n).\nM.3.2  It  is  important  to  understand  that  the  total  system  arc\nrating  cannot  be  determined  by  adding  the  arc  ratings  of  the\nindividual  layers.  In  a  few  cases,  it  has  been  observed  that  the\ntotal  system  arc  rating  actually  decreased  when  another  arc-\nrated  layer  of  a  specific  type  was  added  to  the  system  as  the\noutermost layer. The only way to determine the total system arc\nrating is to conduct a multilayer arc test on the combination of\nall of the layers assembled as they would be worn.\nCopyright National Fire Protection Association \nProvided by IHS Markit under license with NFPA\n\n\nINFORMATIVE ANNEX N\n70E–86\nShaded text = Revisions.

N = New material.\nInformative Annex N   Example Industrial Procedures and Policies for Working Near Overhead\nElectrical Lines and Equipment\nThis informative annex is not a part of the requirements of this NFPA\ndocument but is included for informational purposes only.\nN.1  Introduction.  This informative annex is an example of an\nindustrial   procedure   for   working   near   overhead   electrical\nsystems.  Areas  covered  include  operations  that  could  expose\nemployees  or  equipment  to  contact  with  overhead  electrical\nsystems.\nWhen  working  near  electrical  lines  or  equipment,  avoid\ndirect  or  indirect  contact.  Direct  contact  is  contact  with  any\npart  of  the  body.  Indirect  contact  is  when  part  of  the  body\ntouches  or  is  in  dangerous  proximity  to  any  object  in  contact\nwith   energized   electrical   equipment.   The   following   two\nassumptions should always be made:\n(1)Lines are “live” (energized).\n(2)Lines are operating at high voltage (over 1000 volts).\nAs  the  voltage  increases,  the  minimum  working  clearances\nincrease.  Through  arc-over,  injuries  or  fatalities  could  occur,\neven  if  actual  contact  with  high-voltage  lines  or  equipment  is\nnot made. Potential for arc-over increases as the voltage increa‐\nses.\nN.2 Overhead   Power   Line   Policy   (OPP).  This   informative\nannex applies to all overhead conductors, regardless of voltage,\nand requires the following:\n(1)That  employees  not  place  themselves  in  close  proximity\nto  overhead  power  lines.  “Close  proximity”  is  within  a\ndistance  of  3  m  (10  ft)  for  systems  up  to  50  kV,  and\nshould be increased 100 mm (4 in.) for every 10 kV above\n50 kV.\n(2)That  employees  be  informed  of  the  hazards  and  precau‐\ntions when working near overhead lines.\n(3)That  warning  decals  be  posted  on  cranes  and  similar\nequipment  regarding  the  minimum  clearance  of  3  m\n(10 ft).\n(4)That  a  “spotter”  be  designated  when  equipment  is  work‐\ning  near  overhead  lines.  This  person’s  responsibility  is  to\nobserve safe working clearances around all overhead lines\nand to direct the operator accordingly.\n(5)That  warning  cones  be  used  as  visible  indicators  of  the\n3  m  (10  ft)  safety  zone  when  working  near  overhead\npower lines.\nInformational  Note:  “Working  near,”  for  the  purpose  of  this\ninformative annex, is defined as working within a distance from\nany  overhead  power  line  that  is  less  than  the  combined  height\nor  length  of  the  lifting  device  plus  the  associated  load  length\nand  the  required  minimum  clearance  distance  [as  stated  in\nN.2(1)]. Required clearance is expressed as follows:\nRequired  clearance  =  lift  equipment  height  or  length  +  load\nlength + at least 3 m (10 ft)\n(6)That  the  local  responsible  person  be  notified  at  least\n24 hours before any work begins to allow time to identify\nvoltages  and  clearances  or  to  place  the  line  in  an  electri‐\ncally safe work condition.\nN.3  Policy.  All  employees  and  contractors  shall  conform  to\nthe  OPP.  The  first  line  of  defense  in  preventing  electrical\ncontact  accidents  is  to  remain  outside  the  limited  approach\nboundary.  Because  most  company  and  contractor  employees\nare not qualified to determine the system voltage level, a quali‐\nfied  person  shall  be  called  to  establish  voltages  and  minimum\nclearances and take appropriate action to make the work zone\nsafe.\nN.4  Procedures.\nN.4.1  General.  Prior to the start of all operations where poten‐\ntial  contact  with  overhead  electrical  systems  is  possible,  the\nperson  in  charge  shall  identify  overhead  lines  or  equipment,\nreference  their  location  with  respect  to  prominent  physical\nfeatures,  or  physically  mark  the  area  directly  in  front  of  the\noverhead  lines  with  safety  cones,  survey  tape,  or  other  means.\nElectrical  line  location  shall  be  discussed  at  a  pre-work  safety\nmeeting  of  all  employees  on  the  job  (through  a  job  briefing).\nAll company employees and contractors shall attend this meet‐\ning and require their employees to conform to electrical safety\nstandards.  New  or  transferred  employees  shall  be  informed  of\nelectrical hazards and proper procedures during orientations.\nOn  construction  projects,  the  contractor  shall  identify  and\nreference  all  potential  electrical  hazards  and  document  such\nactions  with  the  on-site  employers.  The  location  of  overhead\nelectrical  lines  and  equipment  shall  be  conspicuously  marked\nby  the  person  in  charge.  New  employees  shall  be  informed  of\nelectrical hazards and of proper precautions and procedures.\nWhere there is potential for contact with overhead electrical\nsystems,  local  area  management  shall  be  called  to  decide\nwhether to place the line in an electrically safe work condition\nor  to  otherwise  protect  the  line  against  unintentional  contact.\nWhere  there  is  a  suspicion  of  lines  with  low  clearance  [height\nunder  6  m  (20  ft)],  the  local  on-site  electrical  supervisor  shall\nbe notified to verify and take appropriate action.\nAll electrical contact incidents, including “near misses,” shall\nbe reported to the local area health and safety specialist.\nN.4.2 Look  Up  and  Live  Flags.  In  order  to  prevent  uninten‐\ntional  contact  with  all  aerial  lifts,  cranes,  boom  trucks,  service\nrigs,  and  similar  equipment  shall  use  look  up  and  live  flags.\nThe  flags  are  visual  indicators  that  the  equipment  is  currently\nbeing used or has been returned to its “stowed or cradled” posi‐\ntion.  The  flags  shall  be  yellow  with  black  lettering  and  shall\nstate in bold lettering “LOOK UP AND LIVE.”\nThe procedure for the use of the flag follows.\n(1)When the boom or lift is in its stowed or cradled position,\nthe flag shall be located on the load hook or boom end.\n(2)Prior to operation of the boom or lift, the operator of the\nequipment  shall  assess  the  work  area  to  determine  the\nlocation of all overhead lines and communicate this infor‐\nmation to all crews on site. Once completed, the operator\nshall  remove  the  flag  from  the  load  hook  or  boom  and\ntransfer  the  flag  to  the  steering  wheel  of  the  vehicle.\nOnce the flag is placed on the steering wheel, the opera‐\ntor can begin to operate the equipment.\n(3)After successfully completing the work activity and return‐\ning  the  equipment  to  its  stowed  or  cradled  position,  the\noperator shall return the flag to the load hook.\nCopyright National Fire Protection Association \nProvided by IHS Markit under license with NFPA\n\n\nINFORMATIVE ANNEX N\nShaded text = Revisions.

N = New material.\n70E–87\n(4)The  operator  of  the  equipment  is  responsible  for  the\nplacement of the look up and live flag.\nN.4.3  High Risk Tasks.\nN.4.3.1 Heavy  Mobile  Equipment.  Prior  to  the  start  of  each\nworkday,  a  high-visibility  marker  (orange  safety  cones  or  other\ndevices) shall be temporarily placed on the ground to mark the\nlocation of overhead wires. The supervisors shall discuss electri‐\ncal  safety  with  appropriate  crew  members  at  on-site  tailgate\nsafety talks. When working in the proximity of overhead lines, a\nspotter  shall  be  positioned  in  a  conspicuous  location  to  direct\nmovement  and  observe  for  contact  with  the  overhead  wires.\nThe  spotter,  equipment  operator,  and  all  other  employees\nworking  on  the  job  location  shall  be  alert  for  overhead  wires\nand remain at least 3 m (10 ft) from the mobile equipment.\nAll  mobile  equipment  shall  display  a  warning  decal  regard‐\ning  electrical  contact.  Independent  truck  drivers  delivering\nmaterials  to  field  locations  shall  be  cautioned  about  overhead\nelectrical  lines  before  beginning  work,  and  a  properly  trained\non-site or contractor employee shall assist in the loading or off-\nloading  operation.  Trucks  that  have  emptied  their  material\nshall not leave the work location until the boom, lift, or box is\ndown and is safely secured.\nN.4.3.2 Aerial  Lifts,  Cranes,  and  Boom  Devices.  Where  there\nis  potential  for  near  operation  or  contact  with  overhead  lines\nor  equipment,  work  shall  not  begin  until  a  safety  meeting  is\nconducted  and  appropriate  steps  are  taken  to  identify,  mark,\nand  warn  against  unintentional  contact.  The  supervisor  will\nreview operations daily to ensure compliance.\nWhere  the  operator’s  visibility  is  impaired,  a  spotter  shall\nguide  the  operator.  Hand  signals  shall  be  used  and  clearly\nunderstood  between  the  operator  and  spotter.  When  visual\ncontact  is  impaired,  the  spotter  and  operator  shall  be  in  radio\ncontact. Aerial lifts, cranes, and boom devices shall have appro‐\npriate  warning  decals  and  shall  use  warning  cones  or  similar\ndevices  to  indicate  the  location  of  overhead  lines  and  identify\nthe 3 m (10 ft) minimum safe working boundary.\nN.4.3.3  Tree Work.  Wires shall be treated as live and operating\nat high voltage until verified as otherwise by the local area on-\nsite   employer.   The   local   maintenance   organization   or   an\napproved electrical contractor shall remove branches touching\nwires  before  work  begins.  Limbs  and  branches  shall  not  be\ndropped  onto  overhead  wires.  If  limbs  or  branches  fall  across\nelectrical  wires,  all  work  shall  stop  immediately  and  the  local\narea  maintenance  organization  is  to  be  called.  When  climbing\nor working in trees, pruners shall try to position themselves so\nthat the trunk or limbs are between their bodies and electrical\nwires.  If  possible,  pruners  shall  not  work  with  their  backs\ntoward electrical wires. An insulated bucket truck is the prefer‐\nred method of pruning when climbing poses a greater threat of\nelectrical  contact.  Personal  protective  equipment  (PPE)  shall\nbe used while working on or near lines.\nN.4.4 Underground  Electrical  Lines  and  Equipment.  Before\nexcavation  starts  and  where  there  exists  reasonable  possibility\nof  contacting  electrical  or  utility  lines  or  equipment,  the  local\narea supervision (or USA DIG organization, when appropriate)\nshall  be  called  and  a  request  is  to  be  made  for  identifying/\nmarking the line location(s).\nWhen USA DIG is called, their representatives will need the\nfollowing:\n(1)Minimum  of  two  working  days’  notice  prior  to  start  of\nwork, name of county, name of city, name and number of\nstreet or highway marker, and nearest intersection\n(2)Type of work\n(3)Date and time work is to begin\n(4)Caller’s name, contractor/department name and address\n(5)Telephone number for contact\n(6)Special instructions\nUtilities  that  do  not  belong  to  USA  DIG  must  be  contacted\nseparately.  USA  DIG  might  not  have  a  complete  list  of  utility\nowners.  Utilities  that  are  discovered  shall  be  marked  before\nwork  begins.  Supervisors  shall  periodically  refer  their  location\nto all workers, including new employees, subject to exposure.\nN.4.5 Vehicles  with  Loads  in  Excess  of  4.25  m  (14  ft)  in\nHeight.  This  policy  requires  that  all  vehicles  with  loads  in\nexcess  of  4.25  m  (14  ft)  in  height  use  specific  procedures  to\nmaintain  safe  working  clearances  when  in  transit  below  over‐\nhead lines.\nThe specific procedures for moving loads in excess of 4.25 m\n(14 ft) in height or via routes with lower clearance heights are\nas follows:\n(1)Prior to movement of any load in excess of 4.25 m (14 ft)\nin  height,  the  local  health  and  safety  department,  along\nwith  the  local  person  in  charge,  shall  be  notified  of  the\nequipment move.\n(2)An  on-site  electrician,  electrical  construction  representa‐\ntive,  or  qualified  electrical  contractor  should  check  the\nintended route to the next location before relocation.\n(3)The  new  site  is  to  be  checked  for  overhead  lines  and\nclearances.\n(4)Power lines and communication lines shall be noted, and\nextreme care used when traveling beneath the lines.\n(5)The company moving the load or equipment will provide\na  driver  responsible  for  measuring  each  load  and  ensur‐\ning   each   load   is   secured   and   transported   in   a   safe\nmanner.\n(6)An  on-site  electrician,  electrical  construction  representa‐\ntive, or qualified electrical contractor shall escort the first\nload  to  the  new  location,  ensuring  safe  clearances,  and  a\nservice  company  representative  shall  be  responsible  for\nsubsequent loads to follow the same safe route.\nIf proper working clearances cannot be maintained, the job\nmust be shut down until a safe route can be established or the\nnecessary repairs or relocations have been completed to ensure\nthat a safe working clearance has been achieved.\nAll  work  requiring  movement  of  loads  in  excess  of  4.25  m\n(14 ft) in height are required to begin only after a general work\npermit  has  been  completed  detailing  all  pertinent  information\nabout the move.\nN.4.6 Emergency  Response.  If  an  overhead  line  falls  or  is\ncontacted, the following precautions should be taken:\n(1)Keep everyone at least 3 m (10 ft) away.\n(2)Use  flagging  to  protect  motorists,  spectators,  and  other\nindividuals from fallen or low wires.\n(3)Call  the  local  area  electrical  department  or  electric  util‐\nity immediately.\n(4)Place barriers around the area.\n(5)Do not attempt to move the wire(s).\n(6)Do not touch anything that is touching the wire(s).\n(7)Be alert to water or other conductors present.\nCopyright National Fire Protection Association \nProvided by IHS Markit under license with NFPA\n\n\nINFORMATIVE ANNEX N\n70E–88\nShaded text = Revisions.

N = New material.\n(8)Crews  shall  have  emergency  numbers  readily  available.\nThese numbers shall include local area electrical depart‐\nment, utility, police/fire, and medical assistance.\n(9)If  an  individual  becomes  energized,  DO  NOT  TOUCH\nthe  individual  or  anything  in  contact  with  the  person.\nCall  for  emergency  medical  assistance  and  call  the  local\nutility  immediately.  If  the  individual  is  no  longer  in\ncontact  with  the  energized  conductors,  CPR,  rescue\nbreathing,  or  first  aid  should  be  administered  immedi‐\nately, but only by a trained person. It is safe to touch the\nvictim once contact is broken or the source is known to\nbe de-energized.\n(10)Wires  that  contact  vehicles  or  equipment  will  cause\narcing,   smoke,   and   possibly   fire.   Occupants   should\nremain  in  the  cab  and  wait  for  the  local  area  electrical\ndepartment or utility. If it becomes necessary to exit the\nvehicle,  leap  with  both  feet  as  far  away  from  the  vehicle\nas  possible,  without  touching  the  equipment.  Jumping\nfree of the vehicle is the last resort.\n(11)If  operating  the  equipment  and  an  overhead  wire  is\ncontacted,  stop  the  equipment  immediately  and,  if  safe\nto  do  so,  jump  free  and  clear  of  the  equipment.  Main‐\ntain  your  balance,  keep  your  feet  together  and  either\nshuffle or bunny hop away from the vehicle another 3 m\n(10  ft)  or  more.  Do  not  return  to  the  vehicle  or  allow\nanyone else for any reason to return to the vehicle until\nthe  local  utility  has  removed  the  power  line  from  the\nvehicle  and  has  confirmed  that  the  vehicle  is  no  longer\nin contact with the overhead lines.\nCopyright National Fire Protection Association \nProvided by IHS Markit under license with NFPA\n\n\nINFORMATIVE ANNEX O\nShaded text = Revisions.

This    informative    annex    addresses    the\nresponsibilities   of   the   facility   owner   or   manager   or   the\nemployer  having  responsibility  for  facility  ownership  or  opera‐\ntions  management  to  perform  a  risk  assessment  during  the\ndesign of electrical systems and installations.\nO.1.1  This  informative  annex  covers  employee  safety-related\ndesign  concepts  for  electrical  equipment  and  installations  in\nworkplaces covered by the scope of this standard. This informa‐\ntive annex discusses design considerations that have impact on\nthe application of the safety-related work practices only.\nO.1.2  This  informative  annex  does  not  discuss  specific  design\nrequirements.  The  facility  owner  or  manager  or  the  employer\nshould choose design options that eliminate hazards or reduce\nrisk and enhance the effectiveness of safety-related work practi‐\nces.\nO.2  General Design Considerations.\nO.2.1  Employers,   facility   owners,   and   managers   who   have\nresponsibility  for  facilities  and  installations  having  electrical\nenergy as a potential hazard to employees and other personnel\nshould   ensure   that   electrical   hazard   risk   assessments   are\nperformed  during  the  design  of  electrical  systems  and  installa‐\ntions.\nO.2.2  Design  option  decisions  should  facilitate  the  ability  to\neliminate hazards or reduce risk by doing the following:\n(1)Reducing the likelihood of exposure\n(2)Reducing the magnitude or severity of exposure\n(3)Enabling  achievement  of  an  electrically  safe  work  condi‐\ntion\nO.2.3 Incident   Energy   Reduction   Methods.  The   following\nmethods  have  proved  to  be  effective  in  reducing  incident\nenergy:\n(1)Zone-selective  interlocking.  This  is  a  method  that  allows\ntwo  or  more  circuit  breakers  to  communicate  with  each\nother  so  that  a  short  circuit  or  ground  fault  will  be\ncleared  by  the  breaker  closest  to  the  fault  with  no  inten‐\ntional delay. Clearing the fault in the shortest time aids in\nreducing the incident energy.\n(2)Differential   relaying.   The   concept   of   this   protection\nmethod is that current flowing into protected equipment\nmust equal the current out of the equipment. If these two\ncurrents are not equal, a fault must exist within the equip‐\nment,  and  the  relaying  can  be  set  to  operate  for  a  fast\ninterruption. Differential relaying uses current transform‐\ners  located  on  the  line  and  load  sides  of  the  protected\nequipment and fast acting relay.\n(3)Energy-reducing   maintenance   switching   with   a   local\nstatus  indicator.  An  energy-reducing  maintenance  switch\nallows a worker to set a circuit breaker trip unit to operate\nfaster  while  the  worker  is  working  within  an  arc  flash\nboundary,  as  defined  in  NFPA  70E,  and  then  to  set  the\ncircuit  breaker  back  to  a  normal  setting  after  the  work  is\ncomplete.\n(4)Energy-reducing  active  arc  flash  mitigation  system.  This\nsystem  can  reduce  the  arcing  duration  by  creating  a  low\nimpedance   current   path,   located   within   a   controlled\ncompartment,  to  cause  the  arcing  fault  to  transfer  to  the\nnew  current  path,  while  the  upstream  breaker  clears  the\ncircuit.  The  system  works  without  compromising  existing\nselective   coordination   in   the   electrical   distribution\nsystem.\n(5)Energy-reducing  line  side  isolation.  This  is  equipment\nthat  encloses  the  line  side  conductors  and  circuit  parts\nand  has  been  listed  to  provide  both  shock  and  arc  flash\nprotection  from  events  on  the  line  side  of  a  circuit\nbreaker or switch.\n(6)Arc  flash  relay.  An  arc  flash  relay  typically  uses  light\nsensors to detect the light produced by an arc flash event.\nOnce  a  certain  level  of  light  is  detected,  the  relay  will\nissue a trip signal to an upstream overcurrent device.\n(7)High-resistance  grounding.  A  great  majority  of  electrical\nfaults  are  of  the  phase-to-ground  type.  High-resistance\ngrounding will insert an impedance in the ground return\npath   and   will   typically   limit   the   fault   current   to\n10  amperes  and  below  (at  5  kV  nominal  or  below),  leav‐\ning  insufficient  fault  energy  and  thereby  helping  reduce\nthe arc flash hazard level. High-resistance grounding will\nnot  affect  arc  flash  energy  for  line-to-line  or  line-to-line-\nto-line arcs.\n(8)Current-limiting devices. Current-limiting protective devi‐\nces reduce incident energy by clearing the fault faster and\nby  reducing  the  current  seen  at  the  arc  source.  The\nenergy reduction becomes effective for current above the\ncurrent-limiting  threshold  of  the  current-limiting  fuse  or\ncurrent limiting circuit breaker.\n(9)Shunt-trip.  Adding  a  shunt-trip  that  is  signaled  to  open\nfrom  an  open-fuse  relay  to  switches  800  amperes  and\ngreater  reduces  incident  energy  by  opening  the  switch\nimmediately when the first fuse opens. The reduced clear‐\ning  time  reduces  incident  energy.  This  is  especially  help‐\nful  for  arcing  currents  that  are  not  within  the  current-\nlimiting threshold of the three current-limiting fuses.\nΔO.2.4 Additional   Safety-by-Design   Methods.  The   following\nmethods have proven to be effective in reducing risk associated\nwith an arc flash or shock hazard:\n(1)Installing finger-safe components, covers, and insulating\nbarriers reduces exposure to energized parts.\n(2)Installing  disconnects  within  sight  of  each  motor  or\ndriven  machine  increases  the  likelihood  that  the  equip‐\nment will be put into an electrically safe work condition\nbefore work has begun.\n(3)Installing current limiting cable limiters can help reduce\nincident energy. Additionally, cable limiters can be used\nto  provide  short-circuit  protection  (and  therefore  inci‐\ndent  energy  reduction)  for  feeder  tap  conductors  that\nare  protected  at  up  to  10  times  their  ampacity,  a  situa‐\ntion where the tap conductor can easily vaporize.\n(4)Installing  inspection  windows  for  noncontact  inspection\nreduces the need to open doors or remove covers.\n(5)Installing  a  single  service  fused  disconnect  switch  or\ncircuit  breaker  provides  protection  for  buses  that  would\nbe unprotected if six disconnect switches are used.\nCopyright National Fire Protection Association \nProvided by IHS Markit under license with NFPA\n\n\nINFORMATIVE ANNEX O\n70E–90\nShaded text = Revisions.

Injuries  from  electrical  energy  are  a  significant\ncause  of  occupational  fatalities  in  the  workplace  in  the  United\nStates.  This  standard  specifies  requirements  unique  to  the\nhazards  of  electrical  energy.  By  itself,  however,  this  standard\ndoes  not  constitute  a  comprehensive  and  effective  electrical\nsafety  program.  The  most  effective  application  of  the  require‐\nments of this standard can be achieved within the framework of\na  recognized  health  and  safety  management  system.  ANSI/\nAIHA  Z10,  American  National  Standard  for  Occupational  Health\nand  Safety  Management  Systems,  and  ISO  45001,  Occupational\nHealth  and  Safety  Management  Systems  —  Requirements  with  Guid‐\nance for Use, provides comprehensive guidance on the elements\nof  an  effective  health  and  safety  management  system  and  are\nrecognized standards. ANSI/AIHA Z10 and IS0 45001 are simi‐\nlar   to   other   internationally   recognized   standards,   such   as\nANSI/ISO  14001,  Environmental  Management  Systems  —  Require‐\nments  with  Guidance  for  Use.  Some  companies  and  other  organi‐\nzations have proprietary health and safety management systems\nthat are aligned with the key elements of ANSI/AIHA Z10 and\nISO 45001.\nThe most effective design and implementation of an electri‐\ncal  safety  program  can  be  achieved  through  a  joint  effort\ninvolving  electrical  subject  matter  experts  and  safety  professio‐\nnals knowledgeable about safety management systems.\nSuch   collaboration   can   help   ensure   that   proven   safety\nmanagement principles and practices applicable to any hazard\nin  the  workplace  are  appropriately  incorporated  into  the  elec‐\ntrical safety program.\nThis informative annex provides guidance on implementing\nthis  standard  within  the  framework  of  ANSI/AIHA  Z10  and\nISO 45001 and other recognized or proprietary comprehensive\noccupational health and safety management system standards.\nCopyright National Fire Protection Association \nProvided by IHS Markit under license with NFPA\n\n\nINFORMATIVE ANNEX Q\n70E–92\nShaded text = Revisions. Δ = Text deletions and figure/table revisions.    • = Section deletions. N = New material.\nInformative Annex Q   Human Performance and Workplace Electrical Safety\nThis informative annex is not a part of the requirements of this NFPA\ndocument but is included for informational purposes only.\nQ.1  Introduction.  This   annex   introduces   the   concept   of\nhuman  performance  and  how  this  concept  can  be  applied  to\nworkplace electrical safety.\nHuman  performance  is  an  aspect  of  risk  management  that\naddresses  organizational,  leader,  and  individual  performance\nas factors that either lead to or prevent errors and their events.\nThe objective of human performance is to identify and address\nhuman   error   and   its   negative   consequences   on   people,\nprograms,  processes,  the  work  environment,  an  organization,\nor equipment.\nStudies  by  high-risk  industries  indicate  that  human  error  is\noften  a  root  cause  of  incidents.  The  premise  of  this  annex  is\nthat human error is similarly a frequent root cause of electrical\nincidents. In occupational health and safety terms, an incident\nis  an  occurrence  arising  in  the  course  of  work  that  resulted  in\nor  could  have  resulted  in  an  injury,  illness,  damage  to  health,\nor a fatality (see ANSI/AIHA Z10-2012, Definition of Incident).\nThe hierarchy of risk control methods identified in this and\nother standards is:\n(1)Eliminating the hazard\n(2)Substituting other materials, processes, or equipment\n(3)Using engineering controls\n(4)Establishing  systems  that  increase  awareness  of  potential\nhazards\n(5)Setting  administrative  controls,  e.g.,  training  and  proce‐\ndures, instructions, and scheduling\n(6)Using  PPE,  including  measures  to  ensure  its  appropriate\nselection, use, and maintenance\nThe  purpose  of  these  controls  is  to  either  reduce  the  likeli‐\nhood  of  an  incident  occurring  or  to  prevent  or  mitigate  the\nseverity  of  consequence  if  an  incident  occurs.  No  control  is\ninfallible.  All  of  the  controls  are  subject  to  errors  in  human\nperformance,  whether  at  the  design,  implementation,  or  use\nphase.\nHuman performance addresses managing human error as a\nunique  control  that  is  complementary  to  the  hierarchy  of  risk\ncontrol methods.\nQ.2 Principles  of  Human  Performance.  The  following  are\nbasic principles of human performance:\n(1)People   are   fallible,   and   even   the   best   people   make\nmistakes.\n(2)Error-likely   situations   and   conditions   are   predictable,\nmanageable, and preventable.\n(3)Individual  performance  is  influenced  by  organizational\nprocesses and values.\n(4)People   achieve   high   levels   of   performance   largely\nbecause    of    the    encouragement    and    reinforcement\nreceived from leaders, peers, and subordinates.\n(5)Incidents  can  be  avoided  through  an  understanding  of\nthe reasons mistakes occur and application of the lessons\nlearned from past incidents.\nQ.3 Information     Processing     and     Attention.  The     brain\nprocesses information in a series of interactive stages:\n(1)Attention — where and to what we intentionally or unin‐\ntentionally direct our concentration.\n(2)Sensing  —  sensory  inputs  (hearing,  seeing,  touching,\nsmelling, etc.) receive and transfer information.\n(3)Encoding,  storage,  thinking  —  incoming  information  is\nencoded and stored for later use in decision making (i.e.,\nwhat  to  do  with  information).  This  stage  of  information\nprocessing   involves   interaction   between   the   working\nmemory and long-term memory (capabilities, knowledge,\npast experiences, opinions, and perspectives).\n(4)Retrieval,  acting  —  taking  physical  human  action  based\non the synthesis of attention, sensation, encoded informa‐\ntion, thinking, and decision-making. In a workplace envi‐\nronment  this  would  include  changing  the  state  of  a\ncomponent  using  controls,  tools,  and  computers,  includ‐\ning verbal statements to inform or direct others.\nAccording  to  Rasmussen’s  model  used  to  classify  human\nerror,   workers   operate   in   one   or   more   of   three   human\nperformance  modes:  rule-based  mode,  skill-based  mode,  and\nknowledge-based mode.\nNote: See Rasmussen, J. (1983); Skills, rules, and knowledge;\nsignals,  signs,  and  symbols,  and  other  distinctions  in  human\nperformance  models.  IEEE  Transactions  on  Systems,  Man,  and\nCybernetics, (3), 257-266.\nReason’s   Human   Performance   Generic   Error   Modeling\nSystem  is  an  extension  of  Rasmussen’s  model.  An  individual\nconsciously  or  subconsciously  selects  a  human  performance\nmode  based  on  his  or  her  perception  of  the  situation.  This\nperception  is  usually  a  function  of  the  individual’s  familiarity\nwith  a  specific  task  and  the  level  of  attention  (information\nprocessing) applied to accomplish the activity.\nNote:    See    Reason,    J.    Human    Error.    Cambridge,    UK:\nCambridge University Press, 1990.\nMost  cognitive  psychologists  agree  that  humans  have  a  limi‐\nted  pool  of  attentional  resources  available  to  divide  up  among\ntasks.  This  pool  of  shared  attentional  resources  enables  the\nmind  to  process  information  while  performing  one  or  some‐\ntimes   multiple   tasks.   Some   tasks   require   more   attentional\nresources  than  others.  The  amount  of  attentional  resource\nrequired  to  perform  a  task  satisfactorily  defines  the  mental\nworkload for an individual and is inversely proportional to the\nindividual’s familiarity with the task. An increase in knowledge,\nskill,  and  experience  with  a  task  decreases  the  level  of  atten‐\ntional  resources  required  to  perform  that  task  and  therefore\ndecreases  the  level  of  attentional  resource  allocated  to  that\ntask.\nCritical  points  in  activities  when  risk  is  higher  (increased\nlikelihood  of  harm  or  increased  severity  of  harm,  or  both)\nrequire an increased allocation of attentional resources. Alloca‐\ntion at these critical points can be improved by training, proce‐\ndures, equipment design, and teamwork.\nEach   human   performance   mode   has   associated   errors.\nAwareness  of  which  human  performance  mode  the  individual\nmight  be  in  helps  identify  the  kind  of  errors  that  could  be\nmade  and  which  error  prevention  techniques  would  be  the\nmost effective.\nCopyright National Fire Protection Association \nProvided by IHS Markit under license with NFPA\n\n\nINFORMATIVE ANNEX Q\nShaded text = Revisions.

N = New material.\n70E–93\nQ.4  Human Performance Modes and Associated Errors.\nQ.4.1  Rule-Based Human Performance Mode.\nQ.4.1.1  General.  An  individual  operates  in  rule-based  human\nperformance mode when the work situation is likely to be one\nthat  he  or  she  has  encountered  before  or  has  been  trained  to\ndeal  with,  or  which  is  covered  by  a  procedure.  It  is  called  the\nrule-based  mode  because  the  individual  applies  memorized  or\nwritten  rules.  These  rules  might  have  been  learned  as  a  result\nof interaction at the workplace, through formal training, or by\nworking with experienced workers.\nThe level of required attentional resources when in the rule-\nbased mode fits between that of the knowledge- and skill-based\nmodes. The time devoted to processing the information (reac‐\ntion  time)  to  select  an  appropriate  response  to  the  work  situa‐\ntion is in the order of seconds.\nThe  rule-based  level  follows  an  IF  (symptom  X),  THEN\n(situation  Y)  logic.  The  individual  operates  by  matching  the\nsigns and symptoms of the situation to some stored knowledge\nstructure, and will usually react in a predicable manner.\nIn human performance theory, rule-based is the most desira‐\nble  performance  mode.  The  individual  can  use  conscious\nthinking  to  challenge  whether  or  not  the  proposed  solution  is\nappropriate.  This  can  result  in  additional  error  prevention\nbeing integrated into the solution.\nNot  all  activities  guided  by  a  procedure  are  necessarily\nexecuted  in  rule-based  mode.  An  experienced  worker  might\nunconsciously default to the skill-based mode when executing a\nprocedure that is normally done in the rule-based mode.\nQ.4.1.2 Rule-Based  Human  Performance  Mode  Errors.  Since\nthe  rule-based  human  performance  mode  requires  interpreta‐\ntion  using  an  \"if-then\"  logic,  misinterpretation  is  the  prevalent\ntype  error  mode.  Errors  involve  deviating  from  an  approved\nprocedure, applying the wrong response to a work situation, or\napplying the correct procedure to the wrong situation.\nQ.4.2  Knowledge-Based Human Performance Mode.\nQ.4.2.1  General.  A    worker    operates    in    knowledge-based\nhuman  performance  mode  when  there  is  uncertainty  about\nwhat  to  do;  no  skill  or  rule  is  readily  identifiable.  The  individ‐\nual  relies  on  their  understanding  and  knowledge  of  the  situa‐\ntion  and  related  scientific  principles  and  fundamental  theory\nto develop an appropriate response. Uncertainty creates a need\nfor  information.  To  gather  information  more  effectively,  the\nindividual’s   attentional   resources   become   more   focused.\nThinking  takes  more  effort  and  energy,  and  the  time  devoted\nto processing the information to select an appropriate response\nto the situation can be in the order of minutes to hours.\nQ.4.2.2 Knowledge-Based  Human  Performance  Mode  Errors.\nThe prevalent error when operating in knowledge-based mode\nis  that  decisions  are  often  based  on  an  inaccurate  mental\npicture   of   the   work   situation.   Knowledge-based   activities\nrequire  decision  making  based  on  diagnosis  and  problem-\nsolving.  Humans  do  not  usually  perform  optimally  in  high-\nstress,  unfamiliar  situations  where  they  are  required  to  “think\non their feet” in the absence of rules, routines, and procedures\nto  handle  the  situation.  The  tendency  is  to  use  only  informa‐\ntion  that  is  readily  available  to  evaluate  the  situation  and  to\nbecome  enmeshed  in  one  aspect  of  the  problem  to  the  exclu‐\nsion  of  all  other  considerations.  Decision-making  is  erroneous\nif  problem-solving  is  based  on  incomplete  or  inaccurate  infor‐\nmation.\nQ.4.3  Skill-Based Human Performance Mode.\nQ.4.3.1  General.  A person is in skill-based mode when execut‐\ning a task that involves practiced actions in a very familiar and\ncommon situation. Human performance is governed by mental\ninstructions  developed  by  either  practice  or  experience  and  is\nless  dependent  on  external  conditions.  The  time  devoted  to\nprocessing the information is in the order of milliseconds. Writ‐\ning  one’s  signature  is  an  example  of  skill-based  performance\nmode. A familiar workplace procedure is typically performed in\nskill-based  performance  mode,  such  as  the  operation  of  a  low-\nvoltage molded case circuit breaker.\nQ.4.3.2 Skill-Based  Human  Performance  Mode  Errors.  The\nrelatively  low  demand  on  attentional  resources  required  when\nan  individual  is  in  skill-based  human  performance  mode  can\ncreate the following errors:\n(1)Inattention:  Skill-based  performance  mode  errors  are\nprimarily  execution  errors  involving  omissions  triggered\nby  human  variability,  or  not  recognizing  changes  in  task\nrequirements or work conditions related to the task.\n(2)Perceived  reduction  in  risk:  As  familiarity  with  a  task\nincreases,  the  individual’s  perception  of  the  associated\nrisk  is  less  likely  to  match  actual  risk.  A  perceived  reduc‐\ntion   in   risk   can   create   “inattentional   blindness”   and\ninsensitivity to the presence of hazards.\nQ.5 Error  Precursors.  Error  precursors  are  situations  when\nthe  demands  of  the  task  and  the  environment  it  is  performed\nin exceed the capabilities of the individual(s) or the limitations\nof  human  nature.  Error  precursors  can  also  be  unfavorable\nconditions  that  increase  the  probability  for  error  during  a\nspecific  action.  Error  precursors  can  be  grouped  into  four\nbroad categories.\n(1)Task demands — when specific mental, physical, or team\nrequirements to perform a task either exceed the capabil‐\nities   or   challenge   the   limitations   of   the   individual\nassigned to the task.\n(2)Work  environment  —  when  general  influences  of  the\nworkplace,  organizational,  and  cultural  conditions  affect\nindividual performance.\n(3)Individual  capabilities  —  when  an  individual’s  unique\nmental,  physical,  and  emotional  characteristics  do  not\nmatch the demands of the specific task.\n(4)Human  nature  —  when  traits,  dispositions,  and  limita‐\ntions  common  to  all  persons  incline  an  individual  to  err\nunder unfavorable conditions.\nTable  Q.5  provides  a  list  of  specific  examples  for  each  cate‐\ngory.\nWhen  error  precursors  are  identified  and  addressed  then\nthe likelihood of human error is reduced.\nQ.6  Human Performance Tools.\nQ.6.1  Application.  Human performance tools reduce the like‐\nlihood  of  error  when  applied  to  error  precursors.  Consistent\nuse  of  human  performance  tools  by  an  organization  will  facili‐\ntate the incorporation of best practice work. The following are\nsome  human  performance  tools.  See  Table  Q.5  for  a  list  of\nthese tools.\nCopyright National Fire Protection Association \nProvided by IHS Markit under license with NFPA\n\n\nINFORMATIVE ANNEX Q\n70E–94\nShaded text = Revisions.

Incorporating  a  job  site  review\ninto  job  planning  facilitates  the  identification  of  hazards  and\npotential   barriers   and   delays.   A   job   site   review   can   be\nperformed any time prior or during work.\nQ.6.4 Post-Job  Review  Tool.  A  post-job  review  is  a  positive\nopportunity  to  capture  feedback  and  lessons  learned  from  the\njob that can be applied to future jobs. The use of or lack of use\nof  human  performance  tools  should  be  incorporated  into  the\nreview.\nThe  pre-job  briefing  and  the  post-job  review  are  effective\ncommunication tools.\nTable Q.5  Error Precursor Identification and Human Performance Tool Selection (see Q.5 and Q.6.1)\nError Precursors\nOptimal\nTool(s)Human Performance Tools\nTask Demands1 Pre-job briefing\nTime pressure (in a hurry)Identify hazards, assess risk and select and implement risk \ncontrols from a hierarchy of methodsHigh workload (memory requirements)\nSimultaneous or multiple tasks\n2 Job site review\nRepetitive actions or monotonyIncreased situational awareness\nCritical steps or irreversible acts\n3 Post-job review\nInterpretation requirementsIdentify ways to improve and best practices\nUnclear goals, roles, or responsibilitiesPeer check\nLack of or unclear standards\n4 Procedure use and adherence\nWork Environment\nStep-by-step procedure read, outcome understood\nDistractions/interruptionsCircle the task to be performed, check off each task as it is \ncompletedChanges/departures from routine\nConfusing displays or controls\n5 Self-check with verbalization\nWorkarounds/out of service instrumentationStop, Think, Act, Review (STAR)\nObscure electrical supplies or configurationsVerbalize intent before, during, and after each task\nUnexpected equipment conditions\n6 Three-way communication\nLack of alternative indicationDirectives are repeated by receiver back to sender; receiver \nis acknowledged by senderPersonality conflicts\nIndividual Capabilities\nUse of the phonetic alphabet for clarity\nUnfamiliar with, or first time performing task\n7 Stop when unsure\nLack of knowledge (faulty mental model)Stop and obtain further direction when unable to follow a \nprocedure or process step or if something unexpected \noccurs\nNew technique not used before\nImprecise communication habits\nLack of proficiency or experienceMaintain a questioning attitude\nIndistinct problem-solving skills\n8 Flagging and blocking\nUnsafe attitudes for critical taskIdentify (flag) equipment and controls that will be operated\nInappropriate valuesPrevent access (block) equipment and controls that should \nnot be operated\nHuman Nature\nStress (limits attention)\nHabit patterns\nAssumptions\nComplacency/overconfidence\nMind-set\nInaccurate risk perception\nMental shortcuts (biases) or limited short-term memory\nNotes:\nThis table may be utilized when identifying workplace hazards.

Adhering to a writ‐\nten step-by-step sequential procedure is a human performance\ntool.  The  worker  should  proactively  read  and  understand  the\npurpose,  scope,  and  intent  of  all  actions  as  written  and  in  the\nsequence specified.\nAn accurate and current account of progress should be kept\nby marking each step in the procedure as it is completed. This\nensures that if the procedure is interrupted before all the steps\nare completed, the job site or activity can be left in a safe state\nand the procedure can be resumed at the point it was interrup‐\nted.\nIf  the  procedure  cannot  be  used  as  written,  or  if  the  expec‐\nted  result  cannot  be  accurately  predicted,  then  the  activity\nshould be stopped and the issues resolved before continuing.\nAn  example  of  adhering  to  a  written  step-by-step  sequential\nprocedure  is  a  switching  sequence,  wherein  the  sequential\norder of operation of electrical distribution equipment is iden‐\ntified  and  documented  for  the  purposes  of  de-energizing  and\nre-energizing.\nQ.6.6 Self-Check  with  Verbalization  Tool.  The  self-check  with\nverbalization tool is also known by the acronym STAR — Stop,\nThink, Act, and Review. Before, during, and after performing a\ntask  that  cannot  be  reversed,  the  worker  should  stop,  think,\nand openly verbalize their actions. Verbalizing permits the indi‐\nvidual’s brain to slow down to their body speed. It has the effect\nof  keeping  the  individual  focused,  thus  enabling  them  to  act\nand then review their actions.\nExample:  A  worker  has  one  more  routine  task  to  complete\nbefore  the  end  of  shift  —  to  approach  a  group  of  motor\ncontrol  panels  and  close  a  circuit  breaker  in  one  of  those\npanels. The error precursors are task demands (in a hurry) and\nhuman  nature  (complacency).  If  the  worker  verbalizes  each\nstep in the task and the expected outcome of each step, he or\nshe  is  less  likely  to  operate  the  wrong  circuit  breaker  and  will\nbe  prepared  in  the  event  that  the  outcome  of  an  action  does\nnot match the expectation. For example, the worker self checks\nand verbalizes:\n(1)I am at Panel 12 Bravo (12B).\n(2)I am about to close Circuit Breaker 4 Bravo (4B).\n(3)The pump motor heater indicator light will engage bright\nred on Panel 10 Bravo (10B).\n(4)The pump motor should not start.\n(5)If the pump motor starts then I will open Circuit Breaker\n4 Bravo.\n(6)I am now closing Circuit Breaker 4 Bravo.\nQ.6.7 Three-Way      Communication      Tool.  The      three-way\ncommunication  tool  facilitates  a  mutual  understanding  of  the\nmessage  between  the  sender  and  receiver.  After  a  directive  or\nstatement  is  made  by  the  sender,  it  is  repeated  by  the  receiver\nto confirm the accuracy of the message.\nWhen the message includes the use of letters, then whenever\npossible   the   letters   should   be   communicated   using   the\nphonetic alphabet.\nExample:  A  sender  issues  a  directive  over  a  radio  communi‐\ncation  device:  “Close  circuit  breaker  4  Bravo.”  The  receiver\nrepeats  the  message:  “I  understand,  close  circuit  breaker  4\nBravo.”  The  sender  validates  that  the  proper  response  was\nunderstood: “That is correct” or “Affirmative.”\nQ.6.8 Stop  When  Unsure  Tool.  When  a  worker  is  unable  to\nfollow  a  procedure  or  process  step,  if  something  unexpected\noccurs or if the worker has a “gut feeling” that something is not\nright,  then  the  worker  should  stop  and  obtain  further  direc‐\ntion.  The  “stop  when  unsure”  tool  requires  that  the  worker\nmaintain a questioning attitude at all times.\nPhrases  such  as  “I  think”  or  “I’m  pretty  sure,”  whether\nverbalized  or  not,  indicate  that  the  worker  is  in  knowledge-\nbased  mode  and  needs  to  transition  to  rule-based  mode.  This\ntransition should be communicated to co-workers.\nQ.6.9 Flagging and Blocking Tools [see 130.7(E)].  Flagging is a\nmethod  to  ensure  the  correct  component  is  manipulated  or\nworked on at the required time under the required conditions.\nA flag could be a marker, label, or device.\nIt should be used when an error-likely situation or condition\nis present, such as one of the following:\n(1)Similar or “look-alike” equipment\n(2)Work on multiple components\n(3)Frequent operations performed in a short period of time\n(4)Interruption of process critical equipment\nBlocking  is  a  method  of  physically  preventing  access  to  an\narea or equipment controls.\nHinged  covers  on  control  buttons  or  switches,  barricades,\nfences or other physical barriers, whether temporary or perma‐\nnent, are examples of blocking tools.\nBlocking can be used in conjunction with flagging.\nQ.7  Human Performance Warning Flags.\nQ.7.1  General.  There  are  common  process,  organizational,\nsupervisory,  and  worker  performance  weaknesses  that  serve  as\nhuman performance warning flags. These warning flags should\nbe identified by the organization and action should be taken to\naddress the root cause.\nQ.7.2 Program   or   Process.  The   following   are   program   or\nprocess human performance warning flags:\n(1)Risk management processes are over-relied on, instead of\npersonal ownership and accountability for managing risk.\n(2)Risk  management  processes  are  inefficient  or  cumber‐\nsome (“more” is often not better).\nQ.7.3 Organizational  Performance.  The  following  are  organi‐\nzational human performance warning flags:\n(1)Personnel  in  the  organization  tend  to  engage  in  consen‐\nsus  or  group  thinking,  without  encouraging  counterview\npoints.\n(2)Personnel   overly   defer   to   managers   and   perceived\nexperts.\n(3)Activities with high risk are not assigned clear owners.\n(4)Past  success  without  adverse  outcomes  becomes  the  basis\nfor continuing current practices.\n(5)The   organization   assumes   that   risk   management   is\nhealthy  because  a  program  or  process  was  established\n(i.e., complacency exists).\nQ.7.4 Supervisory  Performance.  The  following  are  supervi‐\nsory human performance warning flags:\n(1)Delegation  is  lacking,  with  a  few  individuals  relied  on  to\nmake major decisions.\nCopyright National Fire Protection Association \nProvided by IHS Markit under license with NFPA\n\n\nINFORMATIVE ANNEX Q\n70E–96\nShaded text = Revisions.

N = New material.\n(2)Supervision  is  physically  or  mentally  separated  from  the\njob  site  and  is  insufficiently  aware  of  current  conditions\nand attitudes.\n(3)Personnel  in  the  organization  do  not  understand  how\nrisk is perceived and managed at the worker level.\n(4)Past  success  without  adverse  outcomes  becomes  the  basis\nfor continuing current practices.\n(5)Performance  indicators  are  used  to  justify  existing  risk\nmanagement strategies.\nQ.7.5 Worker Performance.  The following are worker human\nperformance warning flags:\n(1)Individuals  or  groups  exhibit  self-imposed  production\npressure.\n(2)Work activities are considered routine.\n(3)Individuals  are  quick  to  make  risky  judgments  without\ntaking the time to fully understand the situation.\n(4)Past  success  without  adverse  outcomes  becomes  the  basis\nfor continuing current practices.\n(5)Personnel  take  pride  in  their  ability  to  work  through  or\nwith levels of risk that could have been mitigated or elimi‐\nnated.\n(6)Risk  is  not  communicated  effectively  up  the  company.\nIndividuals  assume  that  the  next  level  of  supervision\nknows  or  understands  the  risk  involved  or  that  there  are\ninsufficient resources to manage the risk.\n(7)Problem reporting is not transparent. Individuals are not\nwilling to report high-risk conditions.\nQ.8  Workplace Culture.\nQ.8.1  General.  The reduction or elimination of electrical inci‐\ndents requires that all members at the workplace cultivate and\nconsistently  exhibit  a  culture  that  supports  the  use  of  human\nperformance  tools  and  principles.  Workers,  supervisors,  and\nmanagers  must  all  work  together  to  implement  strong  human\nperformance practices.\nQ.8.2  Workers.  The  safe  performance  of  activities  by  workers\nis  a  product  of  mental  processes  influenced  by  factors  related\nto  the  work  environment,  the  task  demands,  and  the  capabili‐\nties  of  the  worker.  All  need  to  take  responsibility  for  their\nactions and strive to improve themselves, the task at hand, and\nthe  work  environment.  Five  general  practices  that  should  be\nconsistently demonstrated by workers include the following:\n(1)Communication to support a consistent understanding\n(2)Anticipation of error-likely situations and conditions\n(3)Desire to improve personal capabilities\n(4)Reports on all incidents (including “near-miss” incidents)\n(5)A  commitment  to  utilize  human  performance  tools  and\nprinciples\nQ.8.3 Supervisors    and    Managers.  Through    their    actions,\nsupervisors  focus  worker  and  team  efforts  in  order  to  accom‐\nplish  a  task.  To  be  effective,  supervisors  must  understand  what\ninfluences  worker  performance.  Supervisors  promote  positive\noutcomes   into   the   workplace   environment   to   encourage\ndesired  performance  and  results.  Supervisors  must  demon‐\nstrate a passion for identifying and preventing human perform‐\nance  errors.  They  influence  both  individual  and  company\nperformance in order to achieve high levels of workplace elec‐\ntrical  safety.  Five  general  practices  that  should  be  consistently\ndemonstrated by supervisors include the following:\n(1)Promote open communication\n(2)Encourage  teamwork  to  eliminate  error-likely  situations\nand conditions\n(3)Seek out and eliminate broader company weaknesses that\nmay create opportunity for error\n(4)Reinforce desired workplace culture\n(5)Recognize  the  value  in  preventing  errors,  reporting  of\nnear-miss   incidents,   and   the   utilization   of   human\nperformance tools and principles\nQ.8.4 The Organization.  It is important that an organization’s\nprocedures,  processes,  and  values  recognize  and  accept  that\npeople  make  mistakes.  The  policies  and  goals  of  an  organiza‐\ntion   influence   worker   and   supervisor   performance.   Five\ngeneral  practices  that  should  be  consistently  demonstrated  by\nan organization include the following:\n(1)Promote open communication\n(2)Foster  a  culture  that  values  error  prevention  and  the  use\nof human performance tools\n(3)Identify  and  prevent  the  formation  of  error-likely  situa‐\ntions and conditions\n(4)Support  continuous  improvement  and  learning  across\nthe entire organization\n(5)Establish   a   blame-free   culture   that   supports   incident\nreporting  and  proactively  identifies  and  reacts  appropri‐\nately to risk\nCopyright National Fire Protection Association \nProvided by IHS Markit under license with NFPA\n\n\nINFORMATIVE ANNEX R\nShaded text = Revisions.

Capacitors have the ability to store electrical\nenergy  after  the  source  power  has  been  disconnected.  While\nmany systems with capacitors are built with bleed resistors that\nautomatically  discharge  the  stored  energy  within  a  set  time,\nthese  systems  can  sometimes  fail,  leaving  a  thermal,  shock,  arc\nflash,  or  arc  blast  hazard.  Some  capacitor  systems  might  not\nhave  built-in  bleed  resistors.  This  informative  annex  provides\ndetailed guidance on how to properly assess the risk in working\nwith capacitors and implement suitable controls.\nNR.2 Qualification and Training.\nNR.2.1 Qualifications.  Employees who perform work on electri‐\ncal  equipment  with  capacitors  that  exceed  the  energy  thresh‐\nolds   in   360.3   should   be   qualified   persons   as   required   in\nChapter  1  and  should  be  trained  in,  and  familiar  with,  the\nspecific hazards and controls required for safe work.\nNR.2.2 Unqualified   Persons. Unqualified   persons   should   be\ntrained in, and familiar with, any electrical safety-related practi‐\nces necessary for their safety.\nNR.3  Shock Hazard.\nNR.3.1  General.  The  capacitor  shock  hazard  to  a  person  is  an\nimpulse shock with an exponential decay curve. The severity of\nthe shock is related to the amount of energy (joules) delivered\nand  the  time  in  which  the  energy  is  delivered.  Injuries  from\ncapacitor shock include severe reflex action, internal and exter‐\nnal  burns,  and  heart  fibrillation.  Reflex  injury  can  occur  at\nenergy levels as low as 0.25 joules when the capacitor voltage is\nover the skin breakdown threshold (about 400 volts), resulting\nin  a  very  rapid  delivery  of  the  energy.  Reflex  action  can  result\nin  injuries  from  falling,  involuntarily  coming  in  contact  with\nother  hazards,  tearing  muscles,  tendons,  and  ligaments,  or\ndislocation  of  joints.  Internal  burn  injuries  to  nervous  system\nand  other  tissues  can  occur  at  energies  as  low  as  10s  of  joules.\nHeart   fibrillation   can   happen   when   the   voltage   exceeds\n100  volts  and  the  stored  energy  delivered  exceeds  10  joules\nunder  certain  circumstances.  However,  even  without  fibrilla‐\ntion,  a  high-voltage,  high-energy  shock  can  cause  serious  inju‐\nries, either directly or through reflex action, down to as low as\n0.25  joules.  Instances  of  temporary  paralysis,  loss  of  conscious‐\nness,  hearing  damage,  temporary  loss  of  eyesight,  burns,  and\ndislocated joints have been reported. [See Figure R.3.1(a) for a\ncapacitive  shock  circuit  and  Figure  R.3.1(b)  for  a  capacitive\ndischarge curve.]\nNR.3.2 Duration  of  Discharge.  The  duration  of  a  capacitive\ndischarge  shock  is  independent  of  voltage  and  is  generally\nassumed  to  be  three  times  the  time  constant  of  the  shock\ncircuit.  After  three  time  constants,  the  voltage  is  reduced  by\n95 percent, and the energy has been reduced by 99.25 percent.\nThe time constant, τ, is equal to body shock pathway resistance\ntimes capacitance, as follows:\nNR.3.3 Current  Delivered.  The  current  delivered  by  the  shock\nis independent of capacitance and is proportional to the initial\npeak voltage and inversely proportional to shock pathway resist‐\n \n[R.3.2]N\nance. Assuming that all of the stored energy is delivered in 3τ,\nthe rms equivalent current can be expressed as follows:\nI\nV\nR\nrms\np\n=\n6\nwhere:\nI\nrms\n=\nrms current\nV\np\n=\npeak voltage\nR\n=pathway resistance\nNR.3.4 Shock  Pathway.  The  shock  pathway  resistance  depends\non  skin  resistance,  entry  and  exit  locations,  and  internal  body\nresistance. The severity of a capacitor discharge shock depends\non the time of delivery (quickly or slowly) and the energy deliv‐\nered.  A  capacitor  disconnected  from  a  live  voltage  source  has\nonly  a  finite  amount  of  energy  and  can  deliver  that  energy\neither  quickly  or  slowly,  depending  on  specific  shock  pathway\nresistance.  As  shock  pathway  resistance  increases,  the  current\nlowers  but  the  time  to  discharge  also  takes  longer,  and  vice\nversa.  Below  400  volts,  skin  breakdown  is  less  likely  and  skin\nresistance  (over  10,000  ohms  for  intact  skin)  will  significantly\nreduce the shock current and extend discharge time.

Δ = Text deletions and figure/table revisions.    • = Section deletions. N = New material.\ntured, broken, or very wet skin, the contact resistance is 0 ohms\nto 100 ohms.\nNR.3.5 Response  to  Shock  Levels.  For  a  given  stored  energy,\nthere is a difference in response to whether it is a high-voltage,\nlow-capacitance   shock,   or   a   low-voltage,   high-capacitance\nshock. At high voltage and low capacitance, a hazardous shock\nwill  fully  discharge  nearly  instantaneously  (in  microseconds)\nand could miss the vulnerable part of the heart cycle. However,\nthe  full  energy  is  delivered  to  the  person  and  there  could  be\nnerve  or  other  tissue  damage.  At  low  voltage  and  high  capaci‐\ntance,  the  total  discharge  time  can  extend  several  seconds\n(multiple  heart  beats),  behaving  more  like  a  dc  shock.  Both\nscenarios  remain  highly  hazardous  as  fibrillation  could  still\noccur.\nInformational  Note:  For  more  information  on  impulse  shock\nhazards,  see  IEC  TS  60479-2,  Effects  of  Current  on  Humans  and\nLivestock, Part 2, Special Aspects.\nNR.3.6 Reflex  Hazard.  Even  when  fibrillation  does  not  occur,\nthere remains the potential for serious bodily injury, especially\nabove  400  volts.  The  reflex  action  to  an  impulse  shock  can  be\nsevere,  causing  persons  to  fall  off  of  elevated  platforms  or\nladders, knock a body part into nearby objects, or in some cases\ncause  severe  muscle  clenching,  temporary  paralysis,  or  disloca‐\nted  joints.  This  reflex  hazard  extends  to  lower  energies  even\nwhere  fibrillation  is  unlikely.  The  lower  threshold  for  hazard‐\nous reflex shocks is 0.25 joules for over 400 volts.\nNR.3.7 Shock   Hazard   Thresholds.  Capacitors   connected   to\nconductors  or  circuit  parts  operating  at  voltages  equal  to  or\ngreater than 100 volts and containing a stored energy equal to\nor greater than 10 joules present a significant risk of shock and\nfibrillation.  Below  10  joules,  a  significant  risk  of  reflex  action\nleading to injury could exist in the following situations:\n(1)100  volts–400  volts:  if  the  stored  energy  is  greater  than\n1 joule\n(2)>400 volts: if the stored energy is greater than 0.25 joules\nNR.4 Short-Circuit  Hazard.  Capacitors  have  the  unique  ability\nto  discharge  very  rapidly  in  a  shorted  condition  due  to  their\nlow  internal  impedance.  In  ac  power  systems,  faults  typically\noccur  on  the  order  of  milliseconds  and  are  limited  by  trans‐\nformer  impedances.  Battery  faults  take  seconds  or  minutes  to\ndischarge. In contrast, capacitors have very little internal impe‐\ndance  and  can  fully  discharge  in  microseconds,  with  very  high\ndischarge  current.  This  current  can  cause  heating  of  metals,\narc  flash  injury,  and  arc  blast  injury,  dependent  on  the  stored\nenergy  in  the  capacitor.  The  shock  injuries,  including  reflex\nand fibrillation, are discussed in R.3.7. Additional hazards that\ncan  result  from  capacitor  energy  include  those  discussed  in\nR.4.1 through R.4.3.\nNR.4.1 Thermal Hazard.  At around 100 joules, a short through\na metal object in contact with the worker, such as a ring or tool,\ncan  cause  rapid  heating  and  burns  to  the  skin.  Above  1  kJ,\nthere can be substantial heating of metal, arcing, and magnetic\nforces  causing  mechanical  deformation.  Above  10  kJ,  there  is\nmassive   conductor   melting,   massive   magnetic/mechanical\nmotion, and an arc blast hazard.\nwhere:\nV = voltage\nt = time\nVp = peak voltage\nτ = time constant\nR = resistance\nC = capacitance\n0τ\n0%\n50%\nDischarge: \nV (t ) = V\np\n \n. e \nTime constant: τ = RC\n2τ3τ4τ5τ\n<5% after 3 τ\n100%\nτ\n–t\n/\nFIGURE  R.3.1(b)     Typical Exponential Discharge Characteristic of a Capacitor Through a\nResistor.\nCopyright National Fire Protection Association \nProvided by IHS Markit under license with NFPA\n\n\nINFORMATIVE ANNEX R\nShaded text = Revisions. Δ = Text deletions and figure/table revisions.    • = Section deletions. N = New material.\n70E–99\nNR.4.2 Arc  Flash  Hazard.  At  approximately  120  kJ,  there  exists\nsufficient  stored  energy  to  create  an  arc  flash  hazard  (greater\nthan  1.2  cal/cm\n2\n  at  a  working  distance  of  18  in.).  This  is  a\nconservative lower bound that assumes all of the stored energy\nhas  been  converted  to  radiant  heat.  The  threshold  of  120  kJ\ncould  be  lower  for  a  capacitor  in  a  box.  There  could  be  an\nadditional contribution to the arc flash energy from an ac or dc\nsource connected to the capacitor or capacitor bank.\nNR.4.3 Arc  Blast  Hazard.  Capacitors  can  have  a  significant  arc\nblast hazard due to the very high short-circuit current involved.\nThe  effects  of  the  acoustic  shock  wave  can  rupture  eardrums\nand  collapse  lungs.  While  hearing  protection  should  be  used\nabove  100  joules  to  mitigate  against  hearing  damage,  there  is\nno  PPE  for  protection  against  lung  collapse,  which  becomes  a\nhazard above 122 kJ.\nNR.5  Internal Rupture.\nNR.5.1 High  Currents.  When  a  capacitor  is  subjected  to  high\ncurrents,  such  as  a  short  circuit  condition,  internal  stresses\ncould result in violent rupture of the capacitor enclosure.\nNR.5.2  Internal Failure.  When capacitors are used to store large\namounts  of  energy,  internal  failure  of  one  capacitor  in  a  bank\ncould  result  in  the  rupture  and  explosion  of  the  failed  capaci‐\ntors  when  all  other  capacitors  in  the  bank  discharge  into  the\nfault.  Fuses  or  inductive  elements  are  often  used  to  limit  the\nfault  current  from  a  capacitor  bank  into  a  faulted  individual\ncapacitor. Improperly sized fuses or inductive elements for this\napplication could explode.\nNR.5.3 Fire  Hazard.  Rupture  of  a  capacitor  can  create  a  fire\nhazard  from  ignition  of  the  dielectric  fluids.  Dielectric  fluids\ncan release toxic gases when decomposed by fire or the heat of\nan electric arc.\nNR.6  Performing a Risk Assessment for Capacitors.\nNR.6.1 Annex  F.  The  risk  assessment  process  for  capacitors  can\nfollow  the  overall  risk  management  process  found  in  Annex  F.\nThis risk assessment should be coordinated with the shock risk\nassessment of 130.4 and the arc flash risk assessment of 130.5.\nNR.6.2 Exposure  to  Stored  Energy.  Whether  there  is  an  expo‐\nsure  to  capacitor  stored  energy  hazard  should  be  determined.\nAn exposure would exist when a conductor or circuit part that\ncould   potentially   remain   energized   with   hazardous   stored\nenergy  is  not  properly  guarded,  enclosed,  or  insulated.  All\ncircuit  parts  that  are  electrically  connected  to  a  capacitor  or\ncapacitor bank could present this hazard. For example, a power\nfactor correction bank could be in a completely separate enclo‐\nsure;  however,  should  the  bank  remained  charged  for  some\nreason,  the  switchgear  to  which  it  is  connected  could  also\ndeliver the stored energy hazard.\nNR.6.3 Determining  Shock  Hazard.  The  shock  hazard  should\nbe determined using both the voltage and stored energy of the\ncapacitor. A high-voltage capacitor is not a shock hazard below\nthe  energy  threshold  of  0.25  joules.  Use  the  shock  risk  assess‐\nment  process  of  130.4  and  the  dc  shock  approach  boundaries\n(for  capacitors  above  100  volts  and  0.25  joules)  and  PPE\nratings.\nNR.6.4 Determining  Total  Stored  Energy.  The  total  capacitor\nstored energy (see R.8) of the system should be determined.\nNR.6.5 Determining  Arc  Flash.  The  arc  flash  hazard  (see  R.9)\nshould  be  determined.  If  stored  energy  is  greater  than  120  kJ,\nthe arc flash incident energy and the arc flash boundary should\nbe  determined  at  the  appropriate  working  distance.  Appropri‐\nate  arc  flash  PPE  should  be  selected  accordingly,  but  workers\nshould always remain out of the arc blast lung protection boun‐\ndary (see R.6.6).\nNR.6.6  Determining Arc Blast Hazard.  The arc blast hazard (see\nR.10)  should  be  determined.  Hearing  protection  should  be\nused  where  the  stored  energy  exceeds  100  joules.  Where  the\nstored  energy  exceeds  10  kJ,  the  hearing  protection  boundary\nshould  be  calculated.  If  stored  energy  is  above  122  kJ,  deter‐\nmine  the  arc  blast  boundary  for  lung  hazards.  A  lung  collapse\nhazard could exist above 122 kJ. DO NOT ENTER THE LUNG\nPROTECTION  BOUNDARY.  There  is  no  PPE  for  lung  protec‐\ntion.\nNR.6.7  Determine the Test and Grounding Method.  (See R.11.)\nNR.6.8  Determining Discharge Time.  If capacitors are equipped\nwith  bleed  resistors,  or  if  using  a  soft  grounding  system,  the\nrequired  discharge  wait  time  should  be  determined  where\napplicable  (see  R.12).  After  the  discharge  time  a  hard  ground\nstick or hard grounding system should be applied.\nNR.6.9  Written Discharge Procedure.  A written discharge proce‐\ndure should be developed that captures all of the steps to place\nthe  equipment  into  an  electrically  safe  work  condition.  Infor‐\nmation about the amount of stored energy available, how long\nto  wait  after  de-energization  before  opening  the  enclosure,\nhow to test for absence of energy, and what to do if there is still\nstored energy present should be included.\nNR.6.10  Labeling.  Labeling  the  equipment  with  a  hazard  warn‐\ning  label  (see  R.15)  should  be  considered  so  that  qualified\npersons are made aware of the potential for stored energy and\nthe  need  for  a  written  discharge  procedure.  The  maximum\nvoltage and stored energy should be included.\nNR.7  Determining the Shock Hazard.\nNR.7.1 Risk  Assessment.  A  shock  risk  assessment  should  be\nperformed  for  capacitors  exceeding  the  thresholds  in  360.3  in\naccordance  with  130.4.  Shock  approach  boundaries  are  based\non  the  peak  voltage  and  the  dc  shock  approach  boundaries  of\nTable  130.4(E)(b).  Appropriately  rated  shock  protection  PPE,\nsuch  as  voltage-rated  gloves  and  dielectric  insulating  sheeting,\nshould  be  selected.

The  maximum  theoretical  possible  arc\nflash incident energy can be calculated by assuming that all of\nthe  stored  energy  is  dissipated  as  radiant  energy  in  a  spherical\nexpansion in open air.

The arc flash boundary, where IE =\n1.2 cal/cm\n2\n, is then as follows:\nAFBE  cmE  in\nopen  air \n==0 1260 05.().(   .)\nIn a box, we can apply a three times factor over the open-air\nincident energy calculation, as follows:\nIEIE\nboxopen  air\n=   ×3\n \nAFBAFB\nboxopen  air\n=×3\n \nwhere:\nAFB\n=arc flash boundary\nIE\n=incident energy\nThus,  the  minimum  stored  energy  (lower  bound)  required\nto obtain 1.2 cal/cm\n2\n at a working distance of 18 in. is roughly\n44 kJ in a box or 120 kJ in open air. Extreme caution should be\nused  with  the  open-air  calculation,  as  the  arc  flash  boundary\ncan  fall  inside  the  lung  protection  boundary  for  arc  blast.  A\nbetter practice is to always use the box arc flash boundary as a\nminimum approach distance.\nNR.10  Determining the Arc Blast Hazard.\nNR.10.1  Hazard.  The  arc  blast  hazard  is  directly  related  to  the\ninstantaneous  (initial)  short  circuit  current.  Since  capacitors\ncan discharge very rapidly, the shockwave generated by a capac‐\nitor  discharge  can  cause  barotrauma  (overpressure  injury)  to\npersons  in  the  area.  The  most  sensitive  organs  are  the  ears,\nlungs,  and  brain.  When  a  differential  pressure  across  the\neardrums  exceeds  around  20–35  kilopascals  (3–5  psi),  the\neardrum can rupture. At 200 kilopascals (29 psi), lung damage\ncan  occur.  The  following  formulas  are  used  to  estimate  safe\nboundaries  based  on  total  stored  energy,  where  “safe”  is  less\nthan a 1 percent probability of eardrum rupture or lung injury:\nR\nE\near\n=−49 29\n1000\n5 09\n3\n..\nR\nE\nlung\n=−31 32\n1000\n155 45\n3\n..\nwhere:\nR\near\n=eardrum rupture boundary (1 percent probability) in\ncm\nR\nlung\n=\nlung collapse boundary (1 percent probability) in cm\nE\n=capacitor stored energy in joules\nInformational Note: For more information about the derivation\nof  these  formulas,  see  Charles  R.  Hummer,  Richard  J.  Pearson,\nand Donald H. Porschet, “Safe Distances From a High-Energy Capac‐\nitor Bank for Ear and Lung Protection,” Army Research Laboratory\nReport, ARL-TN-608, July 2014.\n \n[R.9.2a]N\n \n[R.9.2b]N\n \n[R.9.2c]N\n \n[R.10.1a]N\n \n[R.10.1b]N\nNR.10.2 Above 122 kJ.  Above 122 kJ a lung collapse hazard can\nexist.  It  is  not  sufficient  to  wear  arc  flash  PPE,  as  this  will  not\nprotect against lung injury. Remain outside of the lung collapse\nboundary.\nNR.10.3 Above 448 kJ.  Above 448 kJ, the lung protection boun‐\ndary  will  be  greater  than  the  arc  flash  boundary  in  open  air\ncalculated in R.9. A better practice is to always use the box arc\nflash  boundary  as  a  minimum  approach  distance.  (See  Figure\nR.10.3.)\nNR.11  Selecting the Appropriate Test and Grounding Method.\nNR.11.1 Method  Selection.  The  method  to  safely  discharge  or\nverify  discharge  of  a  capacitor  will  vary  depending  on  the\ndegree  of  hazard.  Low-voltage,  low-energy  capacitors  can  be\nverified  de-energized  with  a  properly  rated  test  instrument\nmeeting  the  requirements  of  110.8  and/or  hard  grounded.  At\nhigher  energy  and  voltage,  soft  grounding  through  a  resistor\ncould  be  needed  to  limit  the  discharge  current.  At  very  high\nenergies (>100 kJ), manual testing or grounding can become a\nserious  arc  blast  hazard,  and  remote  metering  and  grounding\nshould be performed.\nNR.11.2 Bleed  Systems.  For  systems  with  permanently  installed\nbleed  systems,  testing  for  absence  of  voltage  after  the  pre‐\nscribed  discharge  time  can  be  performed  instead  of  applying\ngrounds.  Testing  can  also  be  performed  as  a  means  to  verify\nabsence of voltage after an automatically switched bleed system\nhas  grounded  the  system.  In  all  cases,  the  test  device  must  be\nrated for the system. (See Table R.11.9 for the appropriate test\nmethod.)\nNR.11.2.1  Below  1000  volts  and  below  10  kJ,  a  properly  rated,\nhigh-impedance digital voltmeter (DVM) can be used.\nNR.11.2.2  Above  1000  volts  and  below  100  joules,  a  properly\nrated,  high-impedance  digital  voltmeter  (DVM)  can  be  used\nwith an approved attachment for measuring high-voltage dc on\nnon-utility   systems.   On   utility   systems,   a   utility-grade,   dc,\nresistive-type voltmeter must be used with a live-line tool.\nNR.11.2.3  Above 1000 volts and between 100 joules and 100 kJ, a\nutility-grade, dc, resistive-type voltmeter can be used with a live-\nline tool.\nNR.11.2.4  Above  100  kJ,  engineered  method  can  be  used  only\nfor verifying absence of voltage.\nNR.11.3 Hard  Grounding.  Hard  grounding  is  the  practice  of\nshorting   a   capacitor   from   terminal   to   terminal   and   then\ndirectly  to  ground.  Since  the  resistance  is  typically  <0.1  ohm,\nthe  discharge  time  is  rapid  and  the  discharge  current  can  be\nhigh. An intense spark and a loud noise can happen at higher\nenergies.  Above  100  joules  there  is  a  hearing  damage  hazard.\nThe  voltage  reversal  associated  with  using  a  hard  ground  can\nput  excessive  voltage  stress  on  the  capacitor.  Since  this  is  an\nequipment issue, check with the manufacturer for their recom‐\nmendations.\nCopyright National Fire Protection Association \nProvided by IHS Markit under license with NFPA\n\n\nINFORMATIVE ANNEX R\n70E–102\nShaded text = Revisions. Δ = Text deletions and figure/table revisions.    • = Section deletions. N = New material.\nNR.11.4 Soft   Grounding.  Soft   grounding   is   the   practice   of\ndischarging a capacitor through a resistor rated for the power.\nThe resistor raises the time constant (τ = RC) and reduces the\npeak discharge current (I = V/R) to safer levels. Soft discharge\nis necessary above 1000 joules.\nNR.11.5 End of Discharge Time.  At the conclusion of the speci‐\nfied  discharge  time,  there  is  still  voltage  on  the  capacitors.  A\nproperly matched resistor and capacitor will reduce the voltage\nto less than 50 volts and the energy to less than 5 joules. At this\npoint hard grounding is applied to fully short the capacitors to\nground.\nNR.11.6 Resistor  Connection  Point.  Sometimes  the  grounding\nresistor is attached directly to the grounding stick. Other times,\nthere  are  two  separate  grounding  points  built  into  the  equip‐\nment  itself.  The  grounding  point  labeled  “High-Z”  is  the  soft\ngrounding  point,  where  “High-Z”  stands  for  high  impedance.\nThe  grounding  point  labeled  “Low-Z”  is  the  hard  grounding\npoint, directly to ground. In this case the same ground stick is\napplied,  first  to  the  High-Z  point,  then  to  the  Low-Z  ground\npoint. See Figure R.11.9.\nNR.11.7 Lung   Protection   Boundary.  The   grounding   method\nshould  keep  all  personnel  clear  of  the  lung  protection  boun‐\ndary.  For  this  reason,  above  100  kJ,  remote  soft  grounding  is\nnecessary.\nNR.11.8 Ground   Sticks.  All   ground   sticks   should   meet   the\nconstruction and periodic inspection requirements of R.16.\nNR.11.9 Use  of  Table  for  Method  Selection.

Other   considerations   are   as\nfollows:\n(1)Charge   transfer:   Grounding   capacitors   in   series   may\ntransfer charge between capacitors rather than discharge\nthe  stored  energy.  Special  precaution  should  be  taken  in\nselecting  the  tools  and  sequence  necessary  to  discharge\ncapacitors  connected  in  series.  Improper  grounding  can\nresult in moving charge around and not fully discharging\nto  ground.  Capacitor  cases  are  not  always  grounded  and\nshould  be  considered  charged  unless  otherwise  deter‐\nmined.\n(2)Dielectric absorption: Not all the energy in a capacitor is\ndissipated  when  it  is  short-circuited  for  a  short  time.\nAlthough   the   charge   on   the   plates   may   be   initially\nremoved, dielectric polarization can cause charge to accu‐\nmulate  after  the  ground  is  removed.  A  voltage  recharge\nof  up  to  10  percent  can  occur  a  few  minutes  after  the\ngrounding or shorting device has been removed. This can\noccur in capacitors with liquid dielectrics, such as an elec‐\ntrolytic  capacitor,  and  in  capacitors  with  solid  dielectrics,\nsuch as polyethylene film capacitors.\n(3)High-voltage  capacitors  can  build  a  charge  in  the  pres‐\nence of high electric fields.\n(4)A momentary hazardous voltage can exist at the moment\nof  contact  across  the  inductance  of  a  few  feet  of  the\ngrounding  cable  of  a  ground  stick  at  the  moment  of\ncontact  with  a  charged  capacitor.  This  is  why  a  worker\nshould   never   hold   the   grounding   cable   during   a\ndischarge event.\nNR.12  Determining the Capacitor Discharge Time.\nNR.12.1 Discharge Time.  The discharge time, T\nd\n, of a capacitor\nis the time it takes to reduce to less than 100 volts. It is related\nto the time constant, τ. The discharge resistance can be perma‐\nnently  installed  on  the  capacitors  (e.g.,  a  bleeder  resistor),\nautomatically  switched  in  after  power  shutoff  (e.g.,  a  resistor\ndump bank), or applied through a soft grounding stick.\nNR.12.2 Voltages   1000   Volts   and   Less.  For   voltages   up   to\n1000 volts, it is sufficient to wait three times the time constant,\nor  one  minute,  whichever  is  greater.  That  is  because  after  3τ,\nthe residual voltage is less than 5 percent of the initial voltage.\nR\nbody\nV\nC\nHard grounding: An insulating stick with a\ngrounding tip is used to discharge a\ncapacitor between its two terminals and \nthen to ground.\nSoft grounding 1: An insulating stick with\na mounted resistor is used to perform a\ncontrolled discharge of the capacitor\ncharge using the High-Z tip first. Then, after\nthe prescribed wait time, hard grounding\nis applied with the second (Low-Z) tip that\nbypasses the resistor.\nSoft grounding 2: An insulating stick with\na grounding tip is first applied to the High-Z\npoint to perform a controlled discharge of\nthe capacitor. Then, after the prescribed \nwait time, the grounding tip is applied to the\nLow-Z point to bypass the resistor and \nhard-ground the capacitor.\nR\nbody\nV\nC\nR\nbody\nV\nC\nHi-Z\nLo-Z\nR\nbleed\nR\nbleed\nHi-Z\nLo-Z\nHigh-Z\nLow-Z\nLow-Z\nHigh-Z\nFIGURE  R.11.9(a)     Illustration of Hard and Soft Grounding Examples\nCopyright National Fire Protection Association \nProvided by IHS Markit under license with NFPA\n\n\nINFORMATIVE ANNEX R\n70E–104\nShaded text = Revisions.

For  voltages  greater\nthan 1000 volts, the discharge time will need to be longer than\n3τ  and  should  be  calculated.

Where   a   conductor\ncircuit  part  is  operating  at  or  above  100  volts  and  10  joules,  a\nwritten  discharge  procedure  (such  as  a  complex  LOTO  proce‐\ndure) should be used to document the necessary steps to place\nthe equipment in an electrically safe work condition. The writ‐\nten  discharge  procedure  should  incorporate  the  results  of  the\nrisk assessment performed in R.6 and specify the following at a\nminimum:\n(1)Voltage in volts\n \n[R.12.3a]N\n \n[R.12.3b]N\n(2)Energy in joules\n(3)Specific  steps  to  safely  discharge  the  capacitor  or  verify\nthat it is discharged\n(4)Specific tool(s)(e.g., ground stick) or engineering system\nto discharge the capacitors, if necessary\n(5)Specific   test   instruments   (e.g.,   DVM)   or   engineered\nsystems used to verify a de-energized state\nNR.13.2 Electrically Safe Work Condition.  In order to place the\nequipment with stored hazardous energy in an electrically safe\nwork  condition,  a  qualified  person  should  follow  the  steps  in\n120.5  as  well  as  the  specific  sequence  outlined  in  the  written\ndischarge procedure. The process to remove stored energy in a\ncapacitor is a part of the overall process to establish an electri‐\ncal  safe  work  condition  in  120.5.  These  would  then  be  as\nfollows:\n(1)Review  the  scope  of  work  and  the  written  discharge\nprocedure.  Determine  all  safe  approach  boundaries  and\nnecessary PPE and tools for the task.\n(2)Perform  a  job  briefing  with  the  personnel  involved  and\nnotify  affected  persons  that  the  equipment  will  be  de-\nenergized.\n(3)After  properly  interrupting  the  supply  current,  open  the\ndisconnecting   device(s)   for   each   source   feeding   the\nequipment.\n(4)Wherever  possible,  visually  verify  that  all  blades  of  the\ndisconnecting devices are fully open or that drawout-type\ncircuit  breakers  are  withdrawn  to  the  fully  disconnected\nposition.\n(5)Apply lockout/tagout devices in accordance with a docu‐\nmented  and  established  policy,  or  use  plug  control  on\nsmaller equipment.\n< 1000 joules\n1000 joules–100 kJ\nDischarge stored\nenergy\nVerify discharge\n(test or ground)\nKeep discharged\n(short and/or\nground)\nBleed resistors\nor automatic\ndischarge\ninstalled?\nBleed resistors\nor automatic\ndischarge\ninstalled?\nHard groundSoft ground\nNONO\nYES\nYES\nOR\n> 100 kJ\nRemote test\nand\nground\nWait the\ndischarge\ntime\nTestSoft ground\nHard ground\nShort out\nterminals or leave\nground applied\nShort out\nterminals or leave\nground applied\nShort out\nterminals or leave\nground applied\nManual test\nand\nground\nWait the\ndischarge\ntime\nOR\nTestHard ground\nFIGURE  R.11.9(b)     Flowchart of Capacitor Test and Grounding Methods to Establish Safe Discharge\nCopyright National Fire Protection Association \nProvided by IHS Markit under license with NFPA\n\n\nINFORMATIVE ANNEX R\nShaded text = Revisions.

For   series   capacitors   these   shorting   wires\nshould  be  attached  across  each  individual  capacitor  and  to\ncase. For single capacitors or for a parallel capacitor bank, the\ngrounding  device  should  be  permitted  to  be  left  hanging  on\nthe  capacitor  terminal  during  the  work  (e.g.,  a  ground  stick/\nhook).\nNR.14  Storage and Disposal.\nNR.14.1 Residual  Charge.  Any  residual  charge  from  capacitors\nshould  be  removed  by  discharging  the  terminals  before  servic‐\ning or removal.\nNR.14.2  Stored Capacitors.  All uninstalled capacitors capable of\nstoring energy exceeding the thresholds of 360.3 at their rated\nvoltage should be short-circuited with a conductor of appropri‐\nate size.\nNR.14.3 Capacitors   Without   Shorting   Wire.  When   an   unin‐\nstalled capacitor is discovered without a shorting wire attached\nto the terminals, it should be treated as energized and charged\nto its full rated voltage until determined otherwise. A qualified\nperson should be contacted to determine the appropriate steps\nto safely discharge the capacitor.\nNR.14.4 Change   in   Initial   Capacitance.  Large,   high-voltage\ncapacitors  are  often  formed  of  a  network  of  smaller  capacitor\nelements connected inside a case. When such a capacitor devel‐\nops  an  internal  open  circuit,  it  can  retain  a  substantial  charge\ninternally   even   though   the   external   terminals   are   short-\ncircuited.  Such  a  capacitor  can  be  hazardous  to  transport\nbecause   the   damaged   internal   wiring   can   reconnect   and\ndischarge the capacitor through the short-circuiting wires. Any\ncapacitor that shows a significant change in capacitance after a\nfault can have this problem. Action should be taken to reduce\nthe risk associated with this hazard when it is discovered.\nNR.15  Capacitor Hazard Labeling.\nNR.15.1  Labeling.  Electrical  equipment  operating  at  or  above\n100  volts  and  10  joules  should  be  field  marked  with  a  label\ncontaining all the following information:\n(1)A   warning   about   the   potential   for   capacitive   stored\nenergy, with the word “WARNING” on an orange colored\nbackground\n(2)Stored energy in joules and the maximum voltage for that\nstored energy\n(3)The  required  wait  time  before  opening  the  enclosure\n(the  wait  time  needs  to  be  greater  than  the  discharge\ntime)\n(4)Date of the stored energy hazard analysis\n(5)An  instruction  that  a  qualified  person  is  necessary  and\nthat they should use a written discharge procedure\nNR.15.2  Labeling  should  conform  to  the  requirements  of  ANSI\nZ535.4, Product Safety Signs and Labels.\nNR.16  Ground Sticks.\nNR.16.1 Use  of  Ground  Sticks.  Ground  sticks  should  be  provi‐\nded for qualified persons to safely discharge any residual stored\nenergy contained in capacitor(s). The ground sticks should be\ndesigned,  constructed,  installed,  and  periodically  inspected  so\nthat  the  full  energy  of  a  capacitor(s)  can  be  safely  discharged.\nSee Table R.11.9 for selection guidance.\nNR.16.2  Construction.  Design and construction are as follows:\n(1)Ground  stick  rod:  When  built  of  fiber  reinforced  plastic\n(FRP), the rod in the ground stick assembly should meet\nASTM  F711,  Standard  Specification  for  Fiberglass-Reinforced\nPlastic (FRP) Rod and Tube Used in Live Line Tools, specifica‐\ntions.  Other  insulating  materials  may  be  used  provided\nthey  are  of  acceptable  insulation  and  durability  for  the\napplication.  The  stick  should  be  long  enough  to  be\nhandled effectively and also to keep a person’s hands out\nof the restricted approach boundary. This should include\na  non-moveable  hand  stop  to  remind  the  worker  during\nuse where to hold the ground stick.\n(2)Ground   stick   tip:   The   ground   stick   connection   to\ndischarge  points  may  be  chain  links,  bare  conductor,  or\nsolid  copper  bar  in  various  geometries.  The  selection  of\nthe  grounding  tip  should  match  the  requirements  of  the\nintended application and ensure that all necessary circuit\nparts are fully discharged and grounded at the same time\nin order to avoid charge transfer. The grounding tips can\nbe designed to remain applied (e.g., a hook) in order to\nsafely   prevent   recharging   from   dielectric   absorption.\nAlternatively,  shorting  straps  may  be  applied  while  the\ngrounding sticks are applied. Discharge points should be\nclearly  marked  and  caution  should  be  used  to  prevent\ntransferring  charge  to  other  capacitors  or  reversing  the\ncharge on affected capacitors.\n(3)Ground stick resistor: Soft grounding should be provided\nwhere  stored  energy  exceeds  1000  joules.  The  resistor\nused to soft ground a capacitor(s) should be fully rated to\nhandle power, voltage, and current. An engineering safety\nmargin  would  be  to  calculate  peak  power,  voltage  and\ncurrent,  and  double  the  resistor  rating  for  each  parame‐\nter. The resistor should be able to discharge the capacitor\nbank  to  less  than  50  volts  and  less  than  5  joules  in  less\nthan 1 minute (less than1000 volts) or less than 5 minutes\n(greater  than  1000  volts).  Ideally,  the  current  should  be\nlimited  to  500  amperes  peak  in  order  to  reduce  the\nmagnetic force on the ground stick and its cable. This can\nrequire a discharge time longer than 5 minutes. Note that\nsoft  grounding  is  always  followed  by  hard  grounding  to\ncomplete the discharge.\n(4)Ground  stick  cable:  The  cable  should  be  grounding  or\nwelding  cable,  flexible  rope  lay,  soft  drawn  copper.  The\nindividual  strands  should  not  be  larger  than  #30  AWG.\nGrounding cables have flexible, transparent elastomer or\nthermoplastic jackets primarily for mechanical protection\nof the conductor it covers and to allow visual examination\nof  stranding  degradation.  Connections  should  be  crim‐\nped  according  to  manufacturer  instructions.  The  lugs\nshould  be  rated  for  the  cables  to  be  clamped.  In  perma‐\nnent  equipment  installations  the  cable  conductor  size\nshould  be  sized  no  smaller  than  #10  AWG  stranded  and\ncapable of safely carrying the potential discharge current.\nFor  temporary  or  benchtop  situations,  the  conductor\nshould   be   capable   of   safely   carrying   any   potential\ndischarge current. Ground sticks should never be fused.\nCopyright National Fire Protection Association \nProvided by IHS Markit under license with NFPA\n\n\nINFORMATIVE ANNEX R\n70E–106\nShaded text = Revisions. Δ = Text deletions and figure/table revisions.    • = Section deletions. N = New material.\nNR.16.3  Installation.  Installation is as follows:\n(1)Connection to building grounding system: Ground sticks\nshould be connected to the building grounding electrode\nsystem  where  practicable.  A  qualified  engineer  should\nevaluate the connection point to the building grounding\nsystem to ensure the integrity of the ground stick system.\nThis connection should be in a location accessible to and\nvisible to the operator of the ground stick. Ground sticks\nshould  be  connected  such  that  impedance  is  less  than\n0.1  ohms  to  ground.  High-Z  ground  sticks  should  be\nconnected  such  that  impedance  is  less  than  0.1  ohms\nbetween the resistor and the ground connection.\n(2)Operator  access:  The  ground  sticks  should  be  perma‐\nnently grounded and stored in the immediate area of the\nequipment  in  a  manner  that  ensures  they  are  used.  The\napproach path to the equipment being grounded should\nbe perpendicular to the equipment and clear of debris or\nobstructions.  The  ground  stick  operator  will  then  always\nbe  facing  the  potential  hazard  and  have  the  grounded\nconductor  between  them  and  the  potentially  energized\nequipment. For cases of capacitors in a field situation, or\nin  portable  equipment,  a  portable  ground  stick  may  be\nused.  The  ground  stick  must  be  effectively  connected  to\nthe system ground, by a bolt or heavy-duty clamp, before\nopening the enclosure.\nNR.16.4  Visual Inspection.  Visual inspection is as follows:\n(1)The ground stick should be visually inspected for defects\nbefore use each day.\n(2)If any defect or contamination that could adversely affect\nthe  insulating  qualities  or  mechanical  integrity  of  the\nground stick is present, the tool should be removed from\nservice.  All  mechanical  connections  should  be  examined\nfor loose connections. Ground sticks should have a hand\nguard that reduces the risk of improper hand position.\n(3)If  the  defect  or  contamination  exists  on  the  grounding\nstick, then it should be replaced.\n(4)If the defect or contamination exists on the cable, then it\nshould  be  replaced  or  repaired  and  tested  before  return\nto service.\nNR.16.5 Biennial Testing (every 2 years).  A ground stick system\nplaces a grounded conductor at the end of the rod between the\noperator  and  the  electrical  hazard.  The  low  impedance  (Low-\nZ) ground stick system is not a live line tool, and there will not\nbe a voltage potential at the end of the ground stick rod. High-\nimpedance (High-Z) ground sticks can have a voltage potential\nat the end of the rod and should be treated as live line tools.\n(1)For  all  ground  sticks:  The  ground  stick  system  should  be\ntested  to  verify  that  impedance  is  less  than  0.1  ohms  to\nground.  This  test  should  be  performed  annually  when  it\nis located outside or under any other adverse conditions.\n(2)All   High-Z   ground   stick   insulating   rods   should   be\nremoved from service to be recertified to the ASTM F711,\nStandard  Specification  for  Fiberglass-Reinforced  Plastic  (FRP)\nRod  and  Tube  Used  in  Live  Line  Tools,  standard  or  equiva‐\nlent.\n(3)High-Z  ground  sticks  with  resistors:  The  resistor  on  the\nHigh-Z  ground  stick  should  be  measured  and  compared\nto the specified value.\nNR.17  References.\n  IEC TS 60479-1, 4th Edition (2005), Effects of\nCurrent  on  Human  Beings  and  Livestock,  Part  1,  General  Aspects,\nGeneva, Switzerland.\nIEC  TS  60479-2,  3rd  Edition  (2007),  Effects  of  Current  on\nHuman Beings and Livestock, Part 2, Special Aspects, Geneva, Swit‐\nzerland.\nDOE-HDBK-1092-2013,   DOE   Handbook   for   Electrical   Safety,\nU.S. Department of Energy, Washington, DC.\nDalziel,  Charles  F.,  “A  Study  of  the  Hazards  of  Impulse\nCurrents,”  Transactions  of  the  American  Institute  of  Electrical  Engi‐\nneers.

  Input accepted from the public or other committees for \nconsideration to develop the First Draft\n•   Technical Committee holds First Draft Meeting to revise \nStandard (23 weeks); Technical Committee(s) with Cor-\nrelating Committee (10 weeks)\n•   Technical Committee ballots on First Draft (12 weeks);\n   Technical Committee(s) with Correlating Committee \n(11 weeks)\n•   Correlating Committee First Draft Meeting (9 weeks)\n•   Correlating Committee ballots on First Draft (5 weeks)\n•   First Draft Report posted on the document information \npage\nStep 2 – Comment Stage\n•   Public Comments accepted on First Draft (10 weeks) fol-\nlowing posting of First Draft Report\n•   If Standard does not receive Public Comments and the \nTechnical Committee chooses not to hold a Second Draft \nmeeting, the Standard becomes a Consent Standard and \nis sent directly to the Standards Council for issuance (see \nStep 4) or\n•   Technical Committee holds Second Draft Meeting \n(21 weeks); Technical Committee(s) with Correlating \nCommittee (7 weeks)\n•  Technical Committee ballots on Second Draft (11 weeks);\n   Technical Committee(s) with Correlating Committee \n(10 weeks)\n•   Correlating Committee Second Draft Meeting (9 weeks)\n•   Correlating Committee ballots on Second Draft  \n(8 weeks)\n•   Second Draft Report posted on the document informa-\ntion page\nStep 3 – NFPA Technical Meeting\n•   Notice of Intent to Make a Motion (NITMAM) accepted \n(5 weeks) following the posting of Second Draft Report\n•   NITMAMs are reviewed and valid motions are certified \nby the Motions Committee for presentation at the NFPA \nTechnical Meeting\n•   NFPA membership meets each June at the NFPA Techni-\ncal Meeting to act on Standards with “Certified Amend-\ning Motions” (certified NITMAMs)\n•   Committee(s) vote on any successful amendments to the \nTechnical Committee Reports made by the NFPA mem-\nbership at the NFPA Technical Meeting\nStep 4 – Council Appeals and Issuance of Standard\n•   Notification of intent to file an appeal to the Standards \nCouncil on Technical Meeting action must be filed within \n20 days of the NFPA Technical Meeting\n•   Standards Council decides, based on all evidence, \nwhether to issue the standard or to take other action\nNotes:\n1. Time periods are approximate; refer to published sched-\nules for actual dates.\n2. Annual revision cycle documents with certified amend-\ning motions take approximately 101 weeks to complete.\n3. Fall revision cycle documents receiving certified amend-\ning motions take approximately 141 weeks to complete.\nCommittee Membership \nClassifications\n1,2,3,4\nThe following classifications apply to Committee members \nand represent their principal interest in the activity of the \nCommittee.\n1.  M  Manufacturer: A representative of a maker or mar-\nketer of a product, assembly, or system, or portion \nthereof, that is affected by the standard.\n2.  U  User: A representative of an entity that is subject to \nthe provisions of the standard or that voluntarily \nuses the standard.\n3.  IM  Installer/Maintainer: A representative of an entity that \nis in the business of installing or maintaining a prod-\nuct, assembly, or system affected by the standard.\n4.  L  Labor: A labor representative or employee concerned \nwith safety in the workplace.\n5.  RT  Applied Research/Testing Laboratory: A representative \nof an independent testing laboratory or indepen-\ndent applied research organization that promulgates \nand/or enforces standards.\n6.  E  Enforcing Authority: A representative of an agency or \nan organization that promulgates and/or enforces \nstandards.\n7.  I  Insurance: A representative of an insurance company, \nbroker, agent, bureau, or inspection agency.\n8. C  Consumer: A person who is or represents the ultimate \npurchaser of a product, system, or service affected by \nthe standard, but who is not included in (2).\n9.  SE  Special Expert: A person not representing (1) through \n(8) and who has special expertise in the scope of the \nstandard or portion thereof.\nNOTE 1: “Standard” connotes code, standard, recom-\nmended practice, or guide.\nNOTE 2: A representative includes an employee.\nNOTE 3: While these classifications will be used by the \nStandards Council to achieve a balance for Technical Com-\nmittees, the Standards Council may determine that new \nclassifications of member or unique interests need repre-\nsentation in order to foster the best possible Committee \ndeliberations on any project. In this connection, the Stan-\ndards Council may make such appointments as it deems \nappropriate in the public interest, such as the classification \nof “Utilities” in the National Electrical Code Committee.\nNOTE 4: Representatives of subsidiaries of any group are \ngenerally considered to have the same classification as the \nparent organization.\n \n6/16-A\nCopyright National Fire Protection Association \nProvided by IHS Markit under license with NFPA\n\n\nSubmitting Public Input / Public Comment Through the Online Submission System \nFollowing publication of the current edition of an NFPA standard, the development of the next edition \nbegins and the standard is open for Public Input.\nSubmit a Public Input \nNFPA accepts Public Input on documents through our online submission system at www.nfpa.org.

Applicable Regulations. The primary rules governing the processing of NFPA standards (codes, standards, \nrecommended practices, and guides) are the NFPA Regulations Governing the Development of NFPA Standards (Regs). Other \napplicable rules include NFPA Bylaws, NFPA Technical Meeting Convention Rules, NFPA Guide for the Conduct of Participants in \nthe NFPA Standards Development Process, and the NFPA Regulations Governing Petitions to the Board of Directors from Decisions of \nthe Standards Council. Most of these rules and regulations are contained in the NFPA Standards Directory. For copies of the \nDirectory, contact Codes and Standards Administration at NFPA headquarters; all these documents are also available on the \nNFPA website at “www.nfpa.org/regs.” \nThe following is general information on the NFPA process. All participants, however, should refer to the actual rules and \nregulations for a full understanding of this process and for the criteria that govern participation. \nII. Technical Committee Report. The Technical Committee Report is defined as “the Report of the responsible \nCommittee(s), in accordance with the Regulations, in preparation of a new or revised NFPA Standard.” The Technical \nCommittee Report is in two parts and consists of the First Draft Report and the Second Draft Report. (See Regs at  \nSection 1.4.)\nIII. Step 1: First Draft Report. The First Draft Report is defined as “Part one of the Technical Committee Report, which \ndocuments the Input Stage.” The First Draft Report consists of the First Draft, Public Input, Committee Input, Committee \nand Correlating Committee Statements, Correlating Notes, and Ballot Statements. (See Regs at 4.2.5.2 and Section 4.3.) \nAny objection to an action in the First Draft Report must be raised through the filing of an appropriate Comment for \nconsideration in the Second Draft Report or the objection will be considered resolved. [See Regs at 4.3.1(b).]\nIV. Step 2: Second Draft Report. The Second Draft Report is defined as “Part two of the Technical Committee Report, \nwhich documents the Comment Stage.” The Second Draft Report consists of the Second Draft, Public Comments with \ncorresponding Committee Actions and Committee Statements, Correlating Notes and their respective Committee \nStatements, Committee Comments, Correlating Revisions, and Ballot Statements. (See Regs at 4.2.5.2 and Section 4.4.) \nThe First Draft Report and the Second Draft Report together constitute the Technical Committee Report. Any outstanding  \nobjection following the Second Draft Report must be raised through an appropriate Amending Motion at the NFPA \nTechnical Meeting or the objection will be considered resolved. [See Regs at 4.4.1(b).]\nV. Step 3a: Action at NFPA Technical Meeting. Following the publication of the Second Draft Report, there is a period \nduring which those wishing to make proper Amending Motions on the Technical Committee Reports must signal their \nintention by submitting a Notice of Intent to Make a Motion (NITMAM). (See Regs at 4.5.2.) Standards that receive \nnotice of proper Amending Motions (Certified Amending Motions) will be presented for action at the annual June NFPA \nTechnical Meeting. At the meeting, the NFPA membership can consider and act on these Certified Amending Motions as \nwell as Follow-up Amending Motions, that is, motions that become necessary as a result of a previous successful Amending \nMotion. (See 4.5.3.2 through 4.5.3.6 and Table 1, Columns 1-3 of Regs for a summary of the available Amending Motions \nand who may make them.) Any outstanding objection following action at an NFPA Technical Meeting (and any further \nTechnical Committee consideration following successful Amending Motions, see Regs at 4.5.3.7 through 4.6.5) must be \nraised through an appeal to the Standards Council or it will be considered to be resolved. \nVI. Step 3b: Documents Forwarded Directly to the Council. Where no NITMAM is received and certified in accordance \nwith the Technical Meeting Convention Rules, the standard is forwarded directly to the Standards Council for action on \nissuance. Objections are deemed to be resolved for these documents. (See Regs at 4.5.2.5.)\nVII. Step 4a: Council Appeals. Anyone can appeal to the Standards Council concerning procedural or substantive matters \nrelated to the development, content, or issuance of any document of the NFPA or on matters within the purview of the \nauthority of the Council, as established by the Bylaws and as determined by the Board of Directors. Such appeals must be in \nwritten form and filed with the Secretary of the Standards Council (see Regs at Section 1.6). Time constraints for filing an \nappeal must be in accordance with 1.6.2 of the Regs. Objections are deemed to be resolved if not pursued at this level. \nVIII. Step 4b: Document Issuance. The Standards Council is the issuer of all documents (see Article 8 of Bylaws). The \nCouncil acts on the issuance of a document presented for action at an NFPA Technical Meeting within 75 days from the \ndate of the recommendation from the NFPA Technical Meeting, unless this period is extended by the Council (see Regs at \n4.7.2). For documents forwarded directly to the Standards Council, the Council acts on the issuance of the document at its \nnext scheduled meeting, or at such other meeting as the Council may determine (see Regs at 4.5.2.5 and 4.7.4). \nIX. Petitions to the Board of Directors. The Standards Council has been delegated the responsibility for the \nadministration of the codes and standards development process and the issuance of documents. However, where \nextraordinary circumstances requiring the intervention of the Board of Directors exist, the Board of Directors may take \nany action necessary to fulfill its obligations to preserve the integrity of the codes and standards development process \nand to protect the interests of the NFPA. The rules for petitioning the Board of Directors can be found in the Regulations \nGoverning Petitions to the Board of Directors from Decisions of the Standards Council and in Section 1.7 of the Regs. \nX. For More Information. The program for the NFPA Technical Meeting (as well as the NFPA website as information \nbecomes available) should be consulted for the date on which each report scheduled for consideration at the meeting will \nbe presented. To view the First Draft Report and Second Draft Report as well as information on NFPA rules and for up-to-\ndate information on schedules and deadlines for processing NFPA documents, check the NFPA website (www.nfpa.org/\ndocinfo) or contact NFPA Codes & Standards Administration at (617) 984-7246. \n4/19-C\nCopyright National Fire Protection Association \nProvided by IHS Markit under license with NFPA\n\n\nCopyright National Fire Protection Association \nProvided by IHS Markit under license with NFPA"
