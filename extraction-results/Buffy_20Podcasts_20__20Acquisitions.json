Our podcasts, which feature sleep sounds like \nrain and contain no spoken content, generate an average annual \nrevenue of €50,000. The sounds are downloaded from Splice.com, \nand no recording is required.\n\n\n\nThe process involves minimal manual labor; the only task is to \nextend a one-minute sound file to an hour, a process known as \n‘looping’.\n\n\n\nOur podcasts are hosted for free on Spreaker.com because we are \na Prime partner. Our agency is the largest sleep podcast \norganization in the world with over 40 million downloads.\n\n\n\nManaging these podcasts requires only 2 hours per week. They are \nprimarily listened to by people suffering from depression or sleep \nissues. Since our podcasts continue to play while our listeners \nsleep, we attract more listeners for advertisements, resulting in high \nadvertising revenue. In some months, we have earned up to \n€15,000 from advertising revenue.\n\nAdvertisers like McDonald’s, Unilever, and BMW have advertised on \nour podcasts. Additionally, we use programmatic ads that are \ninserted into each episode, with an average CPM of $5 per \nthousand listeners. Currently, we have 2 pre-rolls and 2 post-rolls \nactive.\n\n\n\nWe are no longer selling advertisements and have ceased \ncampaigns to promote the podcasts. Despite this, our podcasts \nconsistently rank at the top of the podcast charts on Apple and \nSpotify globally.\n\n\n\nWe are looking for a serious buyer interested in acquiring our \npodcast business, which consists of four sleep podcasts.\n\n\n\nSome ideas we once intended to develop, but never did, include \nlaunching a sleep app and producing meditation podcasts with AI \nvoiceovers through ElevenLabs. Cross-promotion between \npodcasts has proven to be very effective.\n\nASMR Sleep Recordings \nhttps://open.spotify.com/show/1XRHRuE2Z4sWbEU0tGOYbJ\n\n\n\nASMR Rain Recordings \nhttps://open.spotify.com/show/0BRfO7Z1zvnWIvuMEjd8sk\n\n\n\nASMR Sleep \nhttps://open.spotify.com/show/1hNvMeEwkPzuaTuIWLM8iY\n\n\n\nASMR Sessions \nhttps://open.spotify.com/show/673bLsHJCXPV8bG2aXnqz1\n\nLast 12 Months\n\n2023\n\n2022 (During Covid-19)",
