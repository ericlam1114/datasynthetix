This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Firebase Configuration

### Client-Side Firebase

The application uses Firebase for authentication and data storage. You'll need to set up Firebase credentials in your `.env.local` file:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-auth-domain
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-storage-bucket
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-messaging-sender-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
```

### Firebase Admin SDK (Server-Side)

For server-side API routes to properly authenticate with Firebase, you need to set up Firebase Admin SDK credentials. Create a service account in the Firebase console and add the following to your `.env.local` file:

```
FIREBASE_ADMIN_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
FIREBASE_ADMIN_CLIENT_EMAIL=your-service-account-email
FIREBASE_ADMIN_PRIVATE_KEY="your-private-key"
```

Note: The private key should include the full key including `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----` and `-----END PRIVATE KEY-----`, and must be enclosed in quotes.

To create a Firebase service account:
1. Go to the Firebase Console > Project Settings > Service Accounts
2. Click "Generate new private key"
3. Download the JSON file
4. Extract the values and add them to your `.env.local` file
