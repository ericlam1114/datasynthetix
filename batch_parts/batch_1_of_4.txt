SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background
This document contains final regulations that amend the Income Tax Regulations 
(26 CFR part 1) and the Procedure and Administration Regulations (26 CFR part 301) 
to implement the statutory provisions of section 6417 of the Internal Revenue Code 
(Code), as enacted by section 13801(a) of Public Law 117-169, 136 Stat. 1818, 2003 
(August 16, 2022), commonly known as the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA).
I. Overview of Section 6417
An applicable entity that meets all the requirements of section 6417 is permitted 
to make an election under section 6417 with respect to any applicable credit determined 
with respect to the applicable entity for the taxable year (elective payment election).  If 
an applicable entity makes an elective payment election, the applicable entity is treated 
as making a payment against Federal income taxes imposed by subtitle A of the Code 
(subtitle A) for the taxable year with respect to which such credit was determined that is 
equal to the amount of such credit (elective payment amount).  An election under 
section 6417 must be made at such time and in such manner as provided by the 
Secretary of the Treasury or her delegate (Secretary).
Section 6417(b) defines the term “applicable credit” to mean each of the following 
12 credits:
(1) So much of the credit for alternative fuel vehicle refueling property allowed 
under section 30C of the Code that, pursuant to section 30C(d)(1), is treated as a credit 
listed in section 38(b) of the Code (section 30C credit);
(2) So much of the renewable electricity production credit determined under 
section 45(a) of the Code as is attributable to qualified facilities that are originally placed 

in service after December 31, 2022 (section 45 credit);
(3) So much of the credit for carbon oxide sequestration determined under 
section 45Q(a) of the Code as is attributable to carbon capture equipment that is 
originally placed in service after December 31, 2022 (section 45Q credit);
(4) The zero-emission nuclear power production credit determined under 
section 45U(a) of the Code (section 45U credit);
(5) So much of the credit for production of clean hydrogen determined under 
section 45V(a) of the Code as is attributable to qualified clean hydrogen production 
facilities that are originally placed in service after December 31, 2012 (section 45V 
credit);
(6) In the case of a “tax-exempt entity” described in section 168(h)(2)(A)(i), (ii), or 
(iv) of the Code, the credit for qualified commercial vehicles determined under section 
45W of the Code by reason of section 45W(d)(3)
1
 (section 45W credit);
(7) The credit for advanced manufacturing production under section 45X(a) of the 
Code (section 45X credit);
(8) The clean electricity production credit determined under section 45Y(a) of the 
Code (section 45Y credit);
(9) The clean fuel production credit determined under section 45Z(a) of the Code 
(section 45Z credit);
(10) The energy credit determined under section 48 of the Code (section 48 
credit);
(11) The qualifying advanced energy project credit determined under section 48C 
of the Code (section 48C credit); and
(12) The clean electricity investment credit determined under section 48E of the 
1
 The reference was intended to be to section 45W(d)(2).  See General Explanation of Tax Legislation 
Enacted in the 117th Congress, JCS-1-23 (December 21, 2023) at 282.  Thus, the final regulations refer 
to section 45W(d)(2).

Code (section 48E credit).
As described in part II of this Background, section 6417(d) defines an “applicable 
entity” and provides generally applicable rules for making elective payment elections.  
Section 6417(e) through (h) provide special rules applicable under section 6417 that are 
described in part II of this Background.  As described in parts III and IV of this 
Background, section 6417(c), (d)(1)(B) through (D), and (d)(3) also contain special rules 
allowing a taxpayer, including for this purpose a partnership or S corporation, that is not 
an applicable entity (electing taxpayer) to elect to be treated as an applicable entity for 
the limited purpose of making an elective payment election under section 6417, but only 
with respect to section 45Q credits, section 45V credits, and section 45X credits.  Part V 
of this Background describes Notice 2022-50, 2022-43 I.R.B. 325, which, in part, 
requested feedback from the public on potential issues with respect to the elective 
payment election provisions under section 6417.  Part VI of this Background describes 
proposed regulations (REG-101607-23) and temporary regulations (TD 9975) issued 
under section 6417.
II. Applicable Entities and General Elective Payment Election Rules
Section 6417(d)(1)(A) defines the term “applicable entity” to mean:
(1) Any organization exempt from tax imposed by subtitle A;
(2) Any State or political subdivision thereof;
(3) The Tennessee Valley Authority;
(4) An Indian tribal government (as defined in section 30D(g)(9) of the Code);
(5) Any Alaska Native Corporation (as defined in section 3 of the Alaska Native 
Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1602(m)); or
(6) Any corporation operating on a cooperative basis that is engaged in 
furnishing electric energy to persons in rural areas.
Section 6417(d)(2) provides that, in the case of any applicable entity that makes 

the election described in section 6417(a), any applicable credit amount is determined 
(1) without regard to section 50(b)(3) and (4)(A)(i) of the Code (that is, restrictions on 
property used by tax-exempt organizations and governmental units), and (2) by treating 
any property with respect to which such credit is determined as used in a trade or 
business of the applicable entity.
Section 6417(d)(3)(A)(i) provides rules regarding the due date for making any 
elective payment election.  In the case of any government (such as a State, the District 
of Columbia, an Indian tribal government, any U.S. territory) or any political subdivision, 
agency or instrumentality of the foregoing described in section 6417(d)(1) and for which 
no return is required under section 6011 or 6033(a) of the Code, any election under 
section 6417(a) cannot be made later than the date as is determined appropriate by the 
Secretary.  In any other case, any election under section 6417(a) cannot be made later 
than the due date (including extensions of time) for the tax return for the taxable year for 
which the election is made, but in no event earlier than 180 days after the date of the 
enactment of section 6417 (that is, in no event earlier than 180 days after August 16, 
2022, which is February 13, 2023).
Section 6417(d)(3)(A)(ii) provides that any election under section 6417(a), once 
made, is irrevocable, and applies (except as otherwise provided in section 6417(d)(3)) 
with respect to any credit for the taxable year for which the election is made.
Section 6417(d)(3)(B) provides that, in the case of section 45 credits, any 
election under section 6417(a): (1) applies separately with respect to each qualified 
facility; (2) must be made for the taxable year in which such qualified facility is originally 
placed in service; and (3) applies to such taxable year and to any subsequent taxable 
year that is within the 10-year credit period described in section 45(a)(2)(A)(ii) with 
respect to such qualified facility.
Section 6417(d)(3)(C) provides that, in the case of section 45Q credits, any 

election under section 6417(a): (1) applies separately with respect to the carbon capture 
equipment originally placed in service by the applicable entity during a taxable year; and 
(2) applies to such taxable year and to any subsequent taxable year that is within the 
12-year credit period described in section 45Q(a)(3)(A) or (4)(A) with respect to such 
equipment.  Section 6417(d)(3)(C)(i)(II)(aa), (d)(3)(C)(ii), and (d)(3)(C)(iii) provides 
special rules for a taxpayer making the election to be treated as an applicable entity for 
purposes of section 6417 with respect to a section 45Q credit (see part III of this 
Background).
Section 6417(d)(3)(D) provides that, in the case of section 45V credits, any 
election under section 6417(a): (1) applies separately with respect to each qualified 
clean hydrogen production facility; (2) must be made for the taxable year in which such 
facility is placed in service (or within the 1-year period subsequent to the date of 
enactment of section 6417 in the case of facilities placed in service before December 
31, 2022); and (3) applies to the taxable year and all subsequent taxable years with 
respect to such facility.  Section 6417(d)(3)(D)(i)(III)(aa), (ii), and (iii) provide special 
rules for a taxpayer making the election to be treated as an applicable entity for 
purposes of section 6417 with respect to the 45V credit (see part III of this Background).
Section 6417(d)(3)(E) provides that, in the case of section 45Y credits, any 
election under section 6417(a): (1) applies separately with respect to each qualified 
facility; (2) must be made for the taxable year in which such facility is placed in service; 
and (3) applies to such taxable year and to any subsequent taxable year that is within 
the 10-year credit period described in section 45Y(b)(1)(B) with respect to such facility.
Section 6417(d)(4) provides rules regarding when the elective payment is treated 
as made.  Section 6417(d)(4)(A) provides that, in the case of any government or 
political subdivision described in section 6417(d)(1), and for which no return is required 
under section 6011 or 6033(a), the payment described in section 6417(a) is treated as 

made on the later of the date that a return would be due under section 6033(a) if such 
government or subdivision were described in section 6033 or the date on which such 
government or subdivision submits a claim for credit or refund (at such time and in such 
manner as the Secretary provides).  Section 6417(d)(4)(B) provides that, in any other 
case, the payment described in section 6417(a) is treated as made on the later of the 
due date (determined without regard to extensions) of the return of tax for the taxable 
year or the date on which such return is filed with the IRS.
Section 6417(d)(5) provides that, as a condition of, and prior to, any amount 
being treated as a payment that is made by an applicable entity under section 6417(a), 
the Secretary may require such information or registration as the Secretary deems 
necessary for purposes of preventing duplication, fraud, improper payments, or 
excessive payments under section 6417.
Section 6417(d)(6) provides rules relating to excessive payments.  In the case of 
any amount treated as a payment that is made by the applicable entity under 
section 6417(a), or the amount of the payment made pursuant to section 6417(c), that is 
determined to constitute an excessive payment, the tax imposed on such entity by 
chapter 1 of the Code (chapter 1), regardless of whether such entity would otherwise be 
subject to chapter 1 tax, for the taxable year in which such determination is made is 
increased by an amount equal to the sum of (1) the amount of such excessive payment, 
plus (2) an amount equal to 20 percent of such excessive payment.  The increase equal 
to 20 percent of the excessive payment does not apply if the applicable entity can 
demonstrate that the excessive payment resulted from reasonable cause.
An excessive payment is defined as, with respect to a facility or property for 
which an election is made under section 6417 for any taxable year, an amount equal to 
the excess of (1) the amount treated as a payment that is made by the applicable entity 
under section 6417(a), or the amount of the payment made pursuant to section 6417(c), 

with respect to such facility or property for such taxable year, over (2) the amount of the 
credit that, without application of section 6417, would be otherwise allowable (as 
determined pursuant to section 6417(d)(2) and without regard to section 38(c)) with 
respect to such facility or property for such taxable year.
Section 6417(e) provides a denial of double benefit rule providing that, in the 
case of an applicable entity making an election under section 6417 with respect to an 
applicable credit, such credit is reduced to zero and, for any other purpose under the 
Code, is deemed to have been allowed to such entity for such taxable year.
Section 6417(f) provides a special rule relating to any territory
2
 of the United 
States with a mirror code tax system (as defined in section 24(k) of the Code).  Under 
this rule, section 6417 will not be treated as part of the income tax laws of the United 
States for purposes of determining the income tax law of any such U.S. territory unless 
such U.S. territory elects to have section 6417 be so treated.  Currently, the U.S. Virgin 
Islands, Guam, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands have mirror 
code tax systems.
Section 6417(g) provides basis reduction and recapture rules.  It states that, 
except as otherwise provided in section 6417(c)(2)(A),
3
 rules similar to the rules of 
section 50 apply for purposes of section 6417.
Section 6417(h) authorizes the Secretary to issue regulations or other guidance 
as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of section 6417, including guidance to 
ensure that the amount of the payment or deemed payment made under section 6417 is 
commensurate with the amount of the credit that would be otherwise allowable 
(determined without regard to section 38(c)).
2
 Section 6417(f) uses the term “possession,” but the proposed regulations and these final regulations use 
the alternative term “territory.”
3
 There is no section 6417(c)(2)(A) and the Treasury Department and the IRS believe Congress intended 
to refer instead to section 6417(d)(2)(A).  See General Explanation of Tax Legislation Enacted in the 
117th Congress, JCS-1-23 (December 21, 2023) at 284.  Thus, the proposed and final regulations refer to 
section 6417(d)(2)(A).

III. Special Rules Relating to Electing Taxpayers Making An Election Under Section 
6417(d)(1)(B), (C), or (D)
A taxpayer other than an applicable entity under section 6417(d)(1)(A) (electing 
taxpayer) may make an election to be treated as an applicable entity for the limited 
purpose of making an elective payment election with respect to a section 45V credit, a 
section 45Q credit, or a section 45X credit under section 6417(d)(1)(B), (C), or (D), 
respectively.  An electing taxpayer may make an elective payment election under 
section 6417(d)(1)(B), (C), or (D) at such time and in such manner as the Secretary 
provides (but no election may be made with respect to any taxable year beginning after 
December 31, 2032).  The special rules for such an election are described in parts III.A, 
III.B, and III.C of this Background.
A. Electing taxpayers making an election with respect to section 45V credits
Section 6417(d)(1)(B) allows an electing taxpayer to make an elective payment 
election for any taxable year in which such taxpayer has placed in service a qualified 
clean hydrogen production facility (as defined in section 45V(c)(3)), but only with 
respect to a section 45V credit determined in such year with respect to the electing 
taxpayer.  Pursuant to section 6417(d)(3)(D)(i)(III), such electing taxpayer is treated as 
having made such election for the taxable year with respect to which the election is 
made and each of the four subsequent taxable years ending before January 1, 2033.  
Under section 6417(d)(3)(D)(iii), an electing taxpayer may elect to revoke the 
application of such election, but any such election to revoke, if made, applies to the 
applicable year specified in such election (but not any prior taxable year) and each 
subsequent taxable year within the 5-year period and cannot be revoked.
Section 6417(d)(3)(D)(ii) prohibits an electing taxpayer from making a transfer 
election under section 6418(a) of the Code with respect to a section 45V credit for any 
year for which the electing taxpayer’s election under section 6417(d)(1)(B) is in effect.
B. Electing taxpayers making an election with respect to section 45Q credits

Section 6417(d)(1)(C) allows an electing taxpayer to make an elective payment 
election for any taxable year in which the electing taxpayer has, after December 31, 
2022, placed in service carbon capture equipment at a qualified facility (as defined in 
section 45Q(d)), but only with respect to a section 45Q credit determined in such year 
with respect to such taxpayer.  Pursuant to section 6417(d)(3)(C)(i)(II)(aa), such electing 
taxpayer is treated as having made such election for the taxable year with respect to 
which the election is made and each of the four subsequent taxable years ending before 
January 1, 2033.  Under section 6417(d)(3)(C)(iii), an electing taxpayer may elect to 
revoke the application of such election, but any such election to revoke, if made, applies 
to the applicable year specified in such election (but not any prior taxable year) and 
each subsequent taxable year within the 5-year period and cannot be revoked.
Section 6417(d)(3)(C)(ii) prohibits an electing taxpayer from making a transfer 
election under section 6418(a) with respect to a section 45Q credit for any year for 
which the electing taxpayer’s election under section 6417(d)(1)(C) is in effect.
C. Electing taxpayers making an election with respect to section 45X credits
Section 6417(d)(1)(D) allows an electing taxpayer to make an elective payment 
election for any taxable year in which the electing taxpayer has, after December 31, 
2022, produced eligible components (as defined in section 45X(c)(1)), but only with 
respect to a section 45X credit determined in such year with respect to such taxpayer.  
Pursuant to section 6417(d)(1)(D)(ii)(I), such electing taxpayer is treated as having 
made such election for the taxable year with respect to which the election is made and 
each of the four subsequent taxable years ending before January 1, 2033.  Under 
section 6417(d)(1)(D)(ii)(II), an electing taxpayer may elect to revoke the application of 
such election, but any such election to revoke, if made, applies to the applicable year 
specified in such election (but not any prior taxable year) and each subsequent taxable 
year remaining within the 5-year period and cannot be revoked.

Section 6417(d)(1)(D)(iii) prohibits an electing taxpayer from making a transfer 
election under section 6418(a) with respect to a section 45X credit for any year for 
which the electing taxpayer’s election under section 6417(d)(1)(D) is in effect.
IV. Section 6417 Rules for Partnerships and S corporations
Section 6417(c) provides special rules for partnerships and S corporations that 
hold directly (as determined for Federal tax purposes) a facility or property for which an 
applicable credit is determined.  Section 6417(c)(1) provides that, in the case of any 
applicable credit determined with respect to any facility or property held directly by a 
partnership or S corporation, any elective payment election must be made by such 
partnership or S corporation in the manner provided by the Secretary.  If a partnership 
or S corporation makes an elective payment election with respect to any applicable 
credit, (1) a payment is made to such partnership or S corporation equal to the 
applicable credit amount; (2) section 6417(e) is applied with respect to the applicable 
credit before determining any partner's distributive share, or S corporation shareholder's 
pro rata share, of such applicable credit; (3) any applicable credit amount with respect 
to which the election in section 6417(a) is made is treated as tax exempt income for 
purposes of sections 705 and 1366 of the Code; and (4) a partner’s distributive share of 
such tax exempt income is based on such partner's distributive share of the otherwise 
applicable credit for each taxable year (an S corporation shareholder’s share of tax 
exempt income is based on the shareholder’s pro rata share).
Section 6417(c)(2) provides that, in the case of any facility or property held 
directly by a partnership or S corporation, no election by any partner or shareholder is 
allowed under section 6417(a) with respect to any applicable credit determined with 
respect to such facility or property.
V. Notice 2022-50
On October 24, 2022, the Department of the Treasury (Treasury Department) 

and the IRS published Notice 2022-50, 2022-43 I.R.B. 325, to, among other things, 
request feedback from the public on potential issues with respect to the elective 
payment election provisions under section 6417 that may require guidance.  
Stakeholders submitted more than 200 comments in response to Notice 2022-50.  
Feedback in those comments informed the development of the proposed regulations 
and is described in the preamble to the proposed regulations as appropriate.
VI.  Proposed and Temporary Regulations
On June 21, 2023, the Treasury Department and the IRS published proposed 
regulations under section 6417 (REG-101607-23) in the Federal Register (88 FR 
40528) to provide guidance on elective payment elections (proposed regulations).  
Those proposed regulations included proposed §1.6417-5, which contained proposed 
rules identical to the temporary regulations at §1.6417-5T.  Those temporary regulations 
also were published on June 21, 2023, in the Federal Register (88 FR 40093) to provide 
guidance on the mandatory information and registration requirements for elective 
payment elections.  The provisions of the proposed regulations are explained in greater 
detail in the preamble to the proposed regulations.
Summary of Comments and Explanation of Revisions
This Summary of Comments and Explanation of Revisions summarizes the 
proposed regulations and all the substantive comments submitted in response to the 
proposed regulations.  The Treasury Department and the IRS received 151 written 
comments in response to the proposed regulations.  The comments are available for 
public inspection at www.regulations.gov or upon request.  A hearing was conducted in 
person and telephonically on August 21, 2023, during which 10 presenters provided 
comments.  After full consideration of the comments received, these final regulations 
adopt the proposed regulations with modifications in response to the comments 
described in this Summary of Comments and Explanation of Revisions.  

Comments merely summarizing the proposed regulations, recommending 
statutory revisions to section 6417 or other statutes, or addressing issues that are 
outside the scope of this rulemaking, such as the calculation of applicable credits 
(including any bonus credit amounts) or recommended changes to IRS forms, are 
beyond the scope of these regulations and are not adopted.
I. General Rules and Definitions
A. Applicable entities
Section 6417(d)(1) defines applicable entity.  Proposed §1.6417-1(c) clarified the 
statutory definition of applicable entity pursuant to the Secretary’s authority under 
section 6417(h) to issue regulations necessary to carry out the purposes of section 
6417.  Commenters addressed several aspects of the proposed definitions, as 
described in this Part I.A of the Summary of Comments and Explanation of Revisions.  
1. Any Organization Exempt from the Tax Imposed by Subtitle A
Section 6417(d)(1)(A)(i) defines “applicable entity” as including any organization 
exempt from the tax imposed by subtitle A.  The proposed regulations would have 
clarified that “any organization exempt from the tax imposed by subtitle A” meant (1) 
any organization exempt from the tax imposed by subtitle A by reason of section 501(a) 
of the Code and (2) any organization exempt from the tax imposed by subtitle A 
because it is the government of any U.S. territory or a political subdivision thereof.
A few commenters asked that Puerto Rico-registered nonprofits (those with 
Puerto Rico 1101.01 nonprofit status) be allowed to file for elective payment of 
renewable energy tax credits without having to acquire section 501(c)(3) status.  As the 
preamble to the proposed regulations noted, stakeholders had previously responded to 
Notice 2022-50 by asking whether an entity classified as a nonprofit under State law but 
that does not have Federal tax-exempt status would be described in section 
6417(d)(1)(A).  The preamble to the proposed regulations stated that such an entity 

would not be described in section 6417(d)(1)(A) because it is not exempt from the tax 
imposed by subtitle A (but that some of these entities might meet the requirements of 
another type of applicable entity, such as a State instrumentality, and might be an 
applicable entity on those grounds).  This same answer applies to a Puerto Rico-
registered nonprofit that does not have section 501(c)(3) status.
Multiple commenters urged that homeowners’ associations described in section 
528 of the Code be considered applicable entities under section 6417(d)(1)(A) because 
they are “exempt from the tax imposed by subtitle A” by their statutory language.  Two 
of these commenters noted that other sections within subchapter F of chapter 1 have 
similar statutory language, and one of these commenters thus requested that the final 
regulations be modified to include all organizations considered exempt from income 
taxes pursuant to subchapter F of chapter 1.  In response, these final regulations adopt 
this comment and define “any organization exempt from the tax imposed by subtitle A” 
to include organizations exempt from the tax imposed by subtitle A by reason of 
subchapter F of chapter 1.  Thus, under these final regulations, any organization 
described in sections 501 through 530 of the Code that meets the requirements to be 
recognized as exempt from tax under those sections is an applicable entity eligible to 
make an elective payment election.
No commenters opposed the inclusion of the government of any U.S. territory or 
a political subdivision thereof in this definition; thus, these final regulations adopt this 
definition as proposed.  However, several commenters recommended that the final 
regulations provide an exception to the general rule in section 50(b)(1) for territorial 
applicable entities making elections under section 6417 for investment tax credits, 
advocating that such a rule would provide better parity with domestic applicable entities 
making such elections and would advance the IRA’s purpose by improving access to 
clean energy investment tax credits in U.S. territories.

Since before the IRA, investment tax credits, vehicle-related credits, and energy 
efficiency incentives have included restrictions with respect to property located or used 
in U.S. territories by reference to section 50(b)(1).  Section 50(b)(1) provides that “no 
[investment tax] credit shall be determined . . . with respect to any property which is 
used predominantly outside the United States”
4
 unless section 168(g)(4) applies (which 
provides an exception for any property that is owned by a domestic corporation or by a 
United States citizen other than a citizen entitled to the benefits of section 931 or 933 of 
the Code, and that is used predominantly in a possession of the United States by such 
a corporation or such a citizen, or by a corporation created or organized in, or under the 
law of, a possession of the United States).  The IRA did not amend these provisions; 
instead, the IRA specifically referenced 50(b)(1) in section 30C, incorporated section 
50(b)(1) into section 45W, and did not exclude section 48, 48C, or 48E from the 
application of section 50(b)(1).  Furthermore, section 6417(d)(2) provides special rules 
that enable tax-exempt and government entities to benefit from section 30C, 45W, 48, 
48C, and 48E because it provides that applicable credits are determined without regard 
to sections 50(b)(3) and (4)(A)(i).  However, there is no provision lifting the territory-
related restrictions of section 50(b)(1).  Without specific language in section 6417 or in 
the underlying applicable credits addressing section 50(b)(1), or other compelling 
evidence of congressional intent, a special rule turning off the application of section 
50(b)(1) is not supported by the Code.  Therefore, these final regulations do not adopt 
this recommendation.
One commenter asked for a process under which the Puerto Rico Department of 
Treasury (or any other agency designed by the Governor of Puerto Rico) is designated 
to receive, process, and/or administer elections for elective payments from applicable 
4
 Under section 7701(a)(9) of the Code, “[t]he term ‘United States’ when used in a geographical sense 
includes only the States and the District of Columbia.”

entities and instrumentalities of Puerto Rico, similar to the process for disbursements of 
Coronavirus Relief Funds under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security 
Act, Public Law 116-136, 134 Stat. 281 (March 27, 2020).  The Treasury Department 
and the IRS have determined that creating the suggested process is inappropriate for 
elective payment elections because section 6417 involves the filing of a tax return with 
the IRS.  Accordingly, these final regulations do not adopt this comment.
2. Any State or Political Subdivision Thereof
Section 6417(d)(1)(A)(ii) defines “applicable entity” to include any State or 
political subdivision thereof.  The proposed regulations would have clarified that this 
includes the District of Columbia.  No comments addressed this definition, so these final 
regulations adopt the definition as proposed.
3. Indian Tribal Governments
Section 6417(d)(1)(A)(iv) states that an applicable entity includes an Indian tribal 
government (as defined in section 30D(g)(9)).  To provide Indian tribal governments 
parity with State governments, proposed §1.6417-1(c)(3) would have included 
subdivisions of Indian tribal governments in this definition.  Proposed §1.6417-1(k) 
defined the term Indian tribal government as the recognized governing body of any 
Indian or Alaska Native tribe, band, nation, pueblo, village, community, component 
band, or component reservation, individually identified (including parenthetically) in the 
most recent list published by the Department of the Interior in the Federal Register 
pursuant to section 104 of the Federally Recognized Indian Tribe List Act of 1994 (25 
U.S.C. 5131).  Although no comments were received that directly addressed the 
definition of an Indian tribal government provided in proposed §1.6417-1(c)(3), these 
final regulations clarify the proposed definition by specifying that the most recent list 
published by the Department of the Interior in the Federal Register is the one prior to 
the date on which a relevant elective payment election is made.  (Comments regarding 

Tribal entities other than Indian tribal governments are discussed elsewhere in this 
Summary of Comments and Explanation of Revisions.)
4. Alaska Native Corporations
Section 6417(d)(1)(A)(v) provides that any Alaska Native Corporation (as defined 
in section 3 of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1602(m)) (ANC) is 
an applicable entity.  The proposed regulations would have adopted this definition.  The 
proposed regulations requested comments regarding the definition in proposed 
§1.6417-1(c)(4) and whether additional guidance is necessary regarding consolidated 
groups with ANC common parents.  The Treasury Department and the IRS did not 
receive comments related to this definition, but these final regulations adopt the 
proposed regulation and broaden it to apply to consolidated groups with any applicable 
entity as a common parent, as described in part I.B.5. of this Summary of Comments 
and Explanation of Revisions.
5. Rural Electric Cooperatives
Section 6417(d)(1)(A)(vi) provides that any corporation operating on a 
cooperative basis that is engaged in furnishing electric energy to persons in rural areas 
is an applicable entity.  The proposed regulations did not elaborate on this definition but 
requested comments on whether further clarification of the definition in proposed 
§1.6417-1(c)(6) is necessary.
A few commenters addressed this definition.  Some of these commenters stated 
that “clarity would be better achieved” if the Treasury Department and the IRS would 
refer to tax-exempt electric cooperatives as applicable entities described in 501(c)(12) 
and taxable electric cooperatives as applicable entities described in section 
1381(a)(2)(C) of the Code.  One of these commenters stated that an electric 
cooperative may be described in section 45(e)(2)(A)(iii) as a not-for-profit electric utility 
that had or has received a loan or loan guarantee under the Rural Electrification Act of 

1936.  Another commenter asked that the final regulations also allow a “pre-1962” rural 
electric cooperative under section 1381(a)(2)(C) to be eligible to make an elective 
payment election.  Another commenter asked that the final regulations clarify that rural 
electric cooperatives that file either Form 1120, U.S. Corporation Income Tax Return, or 
Form 990, Return of Organization Exempt from Income Tax, be eligible to make an 
elective payment election.
The Treasury Department and the IRS have concluded that rural electric 
cooperatives as described in section 6417(d)(1)(A)(vi) include rural electric cooperatives 
that do not meet the requirements under section 501(c)(12), as cooperatives that meet 
the requirements under section 501(c)(12) are already considered tax-exempt entities in 
section 6417(d)(1)(A)(i).  To avoid rendering section 6417(d)(1)(A)(vi) superfluous, it is 
necessary to include taxable (nonexempt) rural electric cooperatives in section 
6417(d)(1)(A)(vi).  Taxable (nonexempt) rural electric cooperatives are described in 
section 1381(a)(2)(C) as “any corporation operating on a cooperative basis that is 
engaged in furnishing electric energy to persons in rural areas.”  Thus, these final 
regulations under §1.6417-1(c)(6) clarify that section 6417(d)(1)(A)(vi) means “any 
corporation operating on a cooperative basis that is engaged in furnishing electric 
energy to persons in rural areas as described in section 1381(a)(2)(C) of the Code.”  
These final regulations do not include “any electric cooperative described in section 
45(e)(2)(A)(iii)” in the definition because such section does not exist in the Code, and 
the Treasury Department and the IRS are unsure what cooperatives the commenter is 
referencing.
One commenter recommended that the final regulations clarify that local, publicly 
owned utilities (for example, water and electric) and electric cooperatives (other than 
rural) are eligible entities under section 6417(d)(1)(A)(vi), stating that the proposed 
definition aligns with Congressional intent and that there are more than 2,800 public 

owned utilities and cooperatives in operation combined serving millions of customers 
across the United States.  Because section 6417(d)(1)(A)(vi) requires that a cooperative 
be engaged in furnishing electric energy to persons “in rural areas,” these final 
regulations do not include these entities in the definition of rural electric cooperative.  
However, it is possible that publicly owned utilities and non-profit co-ops could qualify as 
applicable entities under other definitions described in these rules, such as if they are 
considered agencies or instrumentalities of a State, local, territorial, or Tribal 
government.
Multiple commenters asked that the final regulations expand rural electric 
cooperatives to cover workers cooperatives that install solar panels.  These 
commenters also requested clarification as to how to determine an organization is 
(1) operating on a cooperative basis; (2) furnishing electricity; and (3) furnishing 
electricity in a rural area.  The commenters generally suggest adopting existing rules 
under subchapter T of chapter 1 of the Code (subchapter T).
These final regulations do not adopt a specific rule covering workers 
cooperatives that install solar panels because the revision to the definition of rural 
electric cooperatives in the final regulations is sufficient to clarify the meaning of the 
term.  As these final regulations include any corporation operating on a cooperative 
basis that is engaged in furnishing electric energy to persons in rural areas as described 
in section 1381(a)(2)(C), it is the law that applies to those corporations that will apply in 
making the determination with respect to any respective corporation.
With respect to operating on a cooperative basis, a summary of the taxation of 
nonexempt rural electric cooperatives may be helpful in explaining the key principles.  
The rules for tax treatment of most nonexempt cooperatives and their patrons were 
codified with the enactment of subchapter T as part of the Revenue Act of 1962. Public 
Law No. 87-834 (H.R. 10650).  However, section 1381(a)(2)(C) states that subchapter T 

is not applicable to an organization engaged in furnishing electric energy (or providing 
telephone service) to persons in rural areas.  According to the Senate Finance 
Committee Report accompanying the 1962 Act, the intent of Congress was that 
nonexempt rural electric cooperatives would continue to be treated as under “present 
law” as of 1962.  While subchapter T does not expressly control the taxation of 
nonexempt rural electric cooperatives, its foundations rest upon pre-1962 cooperative 
tax law.  As a result, there are certain basic parallels between the tax treatment of 
nonexempt utility (electric and telephone) cooperatives and treatment of other 
cooperative organizations under subchapter T.  Therefore, to extent that subchapter T 
reflects cooperative taxation as it existed prior to 1962, it is instructive in resolving 
certain issues facing rural electric cooperatives.  This is because Congress stated that, 
in enacting subchapter T, it was merely codifying the long common law history of 
cooperative taxation (with the exception of ensuring at least one annual level of tax at 
the cooperative or patron level. See S. Rep. No. 1881, 87th Cong., 1st Sess. 113 
(1962)).  Arguably, the case law post-enactment is merely a continuation and 
refinement of the pre-enactment common law.
Perhaps the most succinct definition of the term “cooperative” for Federal income 
tax purposes was provided by the U.S. Tax Court in Puget Sound Plywood, Inc. v. 
Commissioner, 44 T.C. 305 (1965), acq. 1966-1 C.B. 3:
Under  the  cooperative  association  form  or  organization  .  .  .  ,  the  worker-
members of the association supply their own capital at their own risk; select 
their  own  management  and  supply  their  own  direction  for  the  enterprise, 
through  worker  meetings  conducted  on  a  democratic  basis;  and  then 
themselves  receive  the  fruits  of  their  cooperative  endeavors,  through 
allocations of the same among themselves as coworkers, in proportion to 
the amounts of their active participation in the cooperative undertaking.
The Tax Court went on to describe three guiding principles at the core of 
economic cooperative theory as, id. at 308:
(1)  Subordination  of  capital,  both  as  regards  control  over  the  cooperative 
undertaking, and as regards the ownership of the pecuniary benefits arising 

therefrom; (2) democratic control by the worker-members themselves; and, 
(3) the vesting in and allocation among the worker-members of all fruits and 
increases  arising  from  their  cooperative  endeavor  (i.e.,  the  excess  of 
operating revenues over the costs incurred in generating those revenues), 
in proportion to the worker-members active participation in the cooperative 
endeavor.
The mechanism by which rural electric cooperatives achieve operation at cost is 
the patronage dividend (or capital credit).  The payment of patronage dividends (and 
operation at cost) is critical to achieving cooperative status as defined by Puget Sound, 
so any organization must analyze this issue to determine whether it is operating on a 
cooperative basis.
The comments related to the definition of “furnishing” electricity for purposes of 
section 6417(d)(1)(A)(vi) varied.  For example, some commenters suggested using the 
language in §1.1381-1(b)(4) as the standard, and some suggested the term should not 
be limited to generating and transmitting electricity.  One commenter suggested that a 
percentage of rural nameplate capacity be applied for purposes of the definition of 
“furnishing” electricity, while another commenter stated that a more than de minimis 
standard should be used to meet furnishing requirements.  Consistent with the 
determination that section 6417(d)(1)(A)(vi) will cover rural electric cooperatives 
described in section 1381(a)(2)(C), the Treasury Department and the IRS conclude that 
“furnishing” electricity under section 6417(d)(1)(A)(vi) should be interpreted in the same 
manner as the language in §1.1381-1(b)(4), which provides “[a]ny organization which is 
engaged in generating, transmitting, or otherwise furnishing electric energy.”  The 
purpose of this language in §1.1381-1(b)(4) is to identify rural electric cooperatives 
described in section 1381(a)(2)(C).  Using a similar interpretation for purposes of 
section 6417 means that a cooperative furnishing electric energy under §1.1381-1(b)(4) 
would meet this portion of the definition.  Such a cooperative would not be subject to 
subchapter T as a result of section 1381(a)(2)(C), assuming the electricity is provided to 
rural areas.  

With respect to this conclusion, the Treasury Department and the IRS note that 
some of the commenters identified themselves as cooperatives subject to the provisions 
of subchapter T.  The definition of applicable entity in section 6417(d)(1)(A)(vi) would 
not include a cooperative that is subject to subchapter T, as a cooperative cannot be 
both subject to subchapter T and excepted from subchapter T.  Further, the definition of 
furnishing in §1.1381-1(b)(4), and thus for purposes of section 6417, does not include 
the activity of installation of energy equipment (such as the installation of solar panels), 
as that alone is not the generation or other furnishing of electricity.  Thus, organizations 
evaluating whether their operations include furnishing electricity for purposes of section 
6417 should take this into account.
Consistent with including rural electric cooperatives described in section 
1381(a)(2)(C) and the use of §1.1381-1(b)(4) to determine whether a cooperative is 
“furnishing” electricity, the Treasury Department and the IRS reach a similar conclusion 
with respect to defining “rural” for purposes of section 6417 by reference to §1.1381-
1(b)(4).  Section 1.1381-1(b)(4) provides that the term rural area has the meaning 
assigned to [it] in section 5 of the Rural Electrification Act of 1936, as amended (7 
U.S.C. 924).  Currently 7 U.S.C. 924(b) provides that the term ‘rural area’ is deemed to 
mean any area of the United States not included within the boundaries of any 
incorporated or unincorporated city, village, or borough having a population in excess of 
5,000 inhabitants.
6. Tennessee Valley Authority
Section 6417(d)(1)(A)(iii) states that the Tennessee Valley Authority is an 
applicable entity.  The proposed regulations would have adopted this definition.  No 
commenters addressed this definition, so these final regulations adopt the definition as 
proposed.
7. An Agency or Instrumentality of Certain Applicable Entities

Proposed §1.6417-1(c)(7) would have clarified that an agency or instrumentality 
of (1) any U.S. territory or a political subdivision thereof; (2) any State, the District of 
Columbia, or political subdivision thereof; or (3) an Indian tribal government or a 
subdivision thereof is also an applicable entity eligible to make an elective payment 
election.  The proposed regulations requested comments on this approach to defining 
applicable entities and on whether further guidance is necessary.  Commenters 
addressed both the scope of the definition and whether it should be expanded to include 
Federal agencies and instrumentalities.
i. Scope of the definition of “agency” and “instrumentality”
Several commenters asked for additional clarity on the definition of agencies and 
instrumentalities, such as whether joint powers authorities, housing authorities, transit 
authorities, air authorities, publicly owned utilities, or tax-exempt entities in the water 
sector are included (and one commenter requested a similar clarification pertaining to 
political subdivisions).  Various commenters mentioned application of Rev. Rul. 57-128, 
1957-1 C.B. 311, while two of these commenters asked how the facts and 
circumstances analysis in the revenue ruling would apply to their specific facts.  One 
commenter requested a rule stating that whether an entity is an agency or an 
instrumentality is determined based on (or at least influenced by) State or local law.  
Finally, one commenter asked that the final regulations allow tribes to determine what is 
an agency or instrumentality of an Indian tribal government.
The determination of whether an entity is an agency, instrumentality, or a political 
subdivision (or subdivision in the case of an Indian tribal government) is governed by 
Federal tax law that is outside the scope of these final regulations.  Federal tax 
determinations of whether an entity is an agency or instrumentality of any government 
typically are analyzed on a facts and circumstances basis.  In determining whether an 
entity is an agency or instrumentality for Federal tax purposes, Federal courts have 

applied a test similar to the six-factor test in Rev. Rul. 57-128, which generally provides 
guidance on whether an entity is an instrumentality for purposes of the exemption from 
employment taxes under sections 3121(b)(7) and 3306(c)(7).  See, e.g., Bernini v. 
Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, Eighth District, 420 F. Supp. 2d 1021 (E.D. Mo. 
2005) and Rose v. Long Island Railroad Pension Plan, 828 F.2d 910, 918 (2d Cir. 
1987), cert. denied, 485 U.S. 936 (1988).
Rev. Rul. 57-128 looks to the following six factors:
(1)    Whether the organization is used for a governmental purpose and performs 
a governmental function;
(2)    Whether performance of the organization’s function is on behalf of one or 
more States or political subdivisions;
(3)    Whether there are any private interests involved, or whether the States or 
political subdivisions involved have the powers and interests of an owner;
(4)    Whether control and supervision of the organization is vested in public 
authority or authorities;
(5)    If express or implied statutory or other authority is necessary for the creation 
and/or use of such an instrumentality, and whether such authority exists; 
and
(6)    The degree of financial autonomy and the source of its operating expenses.
The Treasury Department and the IRS are unaware of any different Federal tax 
authority or standard that applies to determine whether an entity qualifies as an 
instrumentality of an Indian tribal government for Federal tax purposes.  The application 
of the facts-and-circumstances analysis in Rev. Rul. 57-128 to any particular entity is 
outside the scope of this rulemaking.   
With respect to political subdivisions, Rev. Rul. 78-276, 1978-2 C.B. 256, states 
that the term “political subdivision” has been defined consistently for all Federal tax 

purposes as denoting either (1) a division of a State or local government that is a 
municipal corporation, or (2) a division of such State or local government that has been 
delegated the right to exercise sovereign power by the State or local government.  The 
three generally acknowledged sovereign powers are the power to tax, the power of 
eminent domain, and the police power.  See Commissioner v. Estate of Shamberg, 3 
T.C. 131 (1944), acq., 1945 C.B. 6, aff'd 144 F.2d 998 (2d Cir. 1944), cert denied, 323 
U.S. 792 (1945).  It is not necessary that all three sovereign powers enumerated in 
Shamberg be delegated.  See Rev. Rul. 77-164, 1977-1 C.B. 20.  However, possession 
of only an insubstantial amount of any or all sovereign powers is not sufficient.  
In determining whether an entity is a division of a State or local governmental 
unit, important considerations are the extent that the entity is (1) controlled by the State 
or local government unit, and (2) motivated by a wholly public purpose. See., e.g., Rev. 
Rul. 78-276, 1978-2 C.B. 256 and Rev. Rul. 83-131, 1983-2 C.B. 184.
Determination of agency, instrumentality, or political subdivision (or subdivision in 
the case of an Indian tribal government) status is based on all the facts and 
circumstances, and additional guidance on this subject is beyond the scope of these 
final regulations.  Generally, however, taxpayers may request a private letter ruling from 
the IRS Office of Chief Counsel to apply applicable law to the organization’s specific set 
of facts.  See Rev. Proc. 2024-1, I.R.B. 2024-1 (containing procedures for letter rulings) 
and Rev. Proc. 2024-3, I.R.B. 2024-1 (containing a list of areas of the Code relating to 
matters on which the IRS will not issue letter rulings).
One commenter asked that an instrumentality be eligible to make an elective 
payment election with respect to its assets that are operated and maintained by a 
private partner under a public-private partnership.  While it is not clear what kind of 
entity the commenter means by “public-private partnership,” if the arrangement is 
treated as a partnership for Federal tax purposes, then the partnership would not be an 

applicable entity listed in section 6417(d)(1)(A).  See part I.B.4 of this Summary of 
Comments and Explanation of Revisions.
ii. Federal agencies and instrumentalities
Several commenters asked that the final regulations include Federal agencies 
and instrumentalities within the definition of applicable entity.  Commenters specifically 
mentioned the United States Postal Service, Federal hydropower agencies, Federal 
Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs), the Army Corps of Engineers, and the 
Bureau of Reclamation.
One commenter stated that the proposed regulations did not provide a 
justification for why Federal agencies or instrumentalities were not included.  This 
commenter did, however, note that, absent statutory authorization to the contrary, 
agency-collected user fees and charges already must be deposited in the Treasury 
General Fund.  Several commenters suggested that the cross-reference in section 
6417(b)(6) – the provision setting out the list of applicable credits – to section 
168(h)(2)(A)(i) should be read to provide Federal agencies and instrumentalities with 
the ability to make an elective payment election for at least section 45W credits.  
Similarly, one commenter asked that PMAs be able to apply, file, and receive all elective 
payments under section 6417 on behalf of the power generating agencies of regional 
Federal power programs.  This commenter stated that PMAs serve as the Federal 
entities responsible for facilitating the funding of and ensuring repayment for the 
regional power program, both expensed annual maintenance and capital improvements, 
and that it would be beneficial to eliminate unnecessary overlap, confusion, and 
administrative burdens to efficiently use elective payments for applicable projects.  
Section 6417(a)(1), however, authorizes an election of an applicable credit only by an 
applicable entity under section 6417(d)(1)(A).  Although the Treasury Department and 
the IRS solicited comments on the issue, no commenter addressed how appropriations 

issues raised by including Federal agencies and instrumentalities (beyond the 
Tennessee Valley Authority, which is specifically listed in the statute) or PMAs within the 
definition of applicable entities could or should be resolved.  The Treasury Department 
and the IRS have thus retained the proposed approach and have not extended the 
definition of applicable entities to those additional entities in these final regulations.
8. Electing Taxpayers
Certain taxpayers that are not listed in section 6417(d)(1)(A) or described in the 
preceding paragraphs may nevertheless make an election to be treated as an 
applicable entity with respect to applicable credit property giving rise to a section 45Q 
credit, section 45V credit, or section 45X credit, as described more fully in part III of this 
Summary of Comments and Explanation of Revisions.  Proposed §1.6417-1(g) would 
have defined an “electing taxpayer” as any taxpayer that is not an applicable entity, but 
makes an election in accordance with proposed §§1.6417-2(b), 1.6417-3, and, if 
applicable, 1.6417-4, to be treated as an applicable entity for a taxable year with respect 
to applicable credits determined with respect to an applicable credit property described 
in proposed §1.6417-1(e)(3), (5), or (7).  No commenters addressed this definition; thus, 
these final regulations adopt the definition as proposed.
B. Entities related to an applicable entity or an electing taxpayer
Proposed §1.6417-2(a) would have provided rules for elective payment elections 
made by entities related to applicable entities or electing taxpayers.  Commenters 
addressed several of these proposed rules.
1. Disregarded Entities
Proposed §1.6417-1(f) defined “disregarded entity” as an entity that is 
disregarded as an entity separate from its owner for Federal income tax purposes.  
Proposed §1.6417-2(a)(1)(ii) would have provided that, if an applicable entity or electing 
taxpayer is the owner (directly or indirectly) of a disregarded entity that directly holds an 

applicable credit property, the applicable entity may make an elective payment election 
for applicable credits determined with respect to the applicable credit property held 
directly by the disregarded entity.
Several commenters asked that the final regulations clarify whether Tribal 
corporations formed under section 17 of the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 are 
considered applicable entities.  In response, these final regulations clarify the definition 
of disregarded entity under §1.6417-1(f), consistent with the current rule in §301.7701-
1(a)(3), to expressly state that the term includes a Tribal corporation incorporated under 
section 17 of the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, as amended (25 U.S.C. 5124), or 
under section 3 of the Oklahoma Indian Welfare Act, as amended (25 U.S.C. 5203), that 
is not recognized as an entity separate from the tribe for Federal tax purposes, and 
therefore is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner for purposes of section 
6417.
One commenter asked that the final regulations treat an applicable entity that is 
the sole shareholder of an S corporation as eligible to make an elective payment 
election for all applicable credits determined with respect to applicable property held by 
the S corporation, in the same manner as an applicable entity that is the owner of a 
disregarded entity would be eligible to make an elective payment election for all 
applicable credits determined with respect to applicable credit property held by the 
disregarded entity.  Another commenter asked that any entity wholly owned by an 
applicable entity be treated as an applicable entity.  This commenter anticipated that 
many applicable entities will want to create special purpose entities to own their tax 
credit eligible projects, but that the classification of such entities as an applicable entity 
can be uncertain.  As an example, the commenter suggested that a city that would 
normally issue bonds through an industrial development authority that is treated as an 
agency or instrumentality of the city may want the industrial development authority to 

create a wholly-owned corporation or limited liability company to be the owner of the 
project.  The commenter stated that it may be difficult to determine whether such wholly-
owned entity of an industrial development authority would also be treated as an agency 
or instrumentality since it is based on a facts and circumstances analysis.  Moreover, 
under §301.7701-2(b)(6), the commenter pointed out that a limited liability company that 
is wholly owned by an agency or instrumentality of a State or local governmental unit 
may be treated as a separate corporation and, therefore, may not be treated as a 
disregarded entity.  In sum, the commenter stated that it saw no policy reason why an 
entity wholly owned by an applicable entity should not be treated as an applicable entity.
The Treasury Department and the IRS have determined that special rules 
disregarding an entity’s Federal tax status for purposes of section 6417(d)(1)(A) are not 
appropriate.  Section 6417(d)(1)(A) is specific as to the types of entities afforded 
applicable entity status.  Any regarded entity that has a Federal tax status separate from 
its owner(s) and is not separately listed in section 6417(d)(1)(A) cannot be treated as an 
applicable entity.  This is consistent with the rule for taxable C corporations discussed in 
part I.B.2 of this Summary of Comments and Explanation of Revisions.
2. Taxable C Corporations
The proposed regulations would have provided that, because a taxable 
C corporation is an entity separate from its owner, proposed §1.6417-1(c)(1) would not 
include a C corporation that is not itself an applicable entity described in proposed 
§1.6417-1(c)(1) as an applicable entity, even if its owner is an applicable entity 
described in proposed §1.6417-1(c)(1).  However, an electing taxpayer may include a 
taxable C corporation (including a member of a consolidated group).  These final 
regulations adopt §1.6417-1(c)(1) as proposed.
3. Undivided Ownership Interests
Proposed §1.6417-2(a)(1)(iii) would have provided that, if an applicable entity is a 

co-owner in an applicable credit property through an arrangement properly treated as a 
tenancy-in-common (TIC) for Federal income tax purposes, or through an organization 
that has made a valid election under section 761(a) of the Code to be excluded from the 
application of subchapter K of chapter 1 (subchapter K), then the applicable entity's 
undivided ownership share of the applicable credit property will be treated as a separate 
applicable credit property owned by such applicable entity, and the applicable entity 
may make an elective payment election for the applicable credits determined with 
respect to such applicable credit property.  Commenters addressed TICs, valid section 
761(a) elections, and joint ownership under section 48E.
i. Tenancies in common and organizations that have made a valid election under 
section 761(a)
Several commenters asked for additional guidance and examples illustrating how 
an applicable entity’s undivided ownership share of applicable credit property is 
determined in the context of renewable energy projects such as wind and solar projects, 
clean hydrogen projects, and electric vehicle infrastructure.  These comments are 
beyond the scope of these final regulations.  The ownership share of a party to a 
transaction will be determined based upon the agreement of the parties and other 
relevant facts and circumstances.
Several commenters stated that the mechanisms for co-ownership allowed under 
the proposed regulations are in common practice today and would allow applicable 
entities to join with other entities in developing applicable credit properties without 
precluding elective payment election choices by project participants.  However, other 
commenters stated that TICs and joint operating agreements (JOAs) that have validly 
elected out of subchapter K are not commonly used in the renewable energy 
marketplace (even by private entities) and can deprive participants of limited liability. 
These commenters stated that these arrangements may be less familiar to applicable 
entities as compared to traditional partnership structures used between public and 

private entities for the development of clean energy projects.  Commenters also opined 
that applicable entities may not be sufficiently resourced to navigate these newer 
commercial law relationships and would be disadvantaged compared to non-applicable 
entities, who can avail themselves of partnership structures in the form of limited 
partnerships or limited liability companies, which provide most members with limited 
liability for State law purposes.
Commenters asked for clear guidance and clarifications as to how a renewable 
energy project could meet the requirements for electing out of subchapter K.  For 
example, one commenter asked how §1.761-2(a) could be applicable in the context of a 
jointly operated renewable energy project.  Section 1.761-2(a) provides, in relevant part, 
that an unincorporated organization the members of which are able to compute their 
income without the necessity of computing partnership taxable income, and that is not 
an organization classifiable as an association, may be excluded from the application of 
subchapter K if the organization is availed of (1) for investment purposes only and not 
for the active conduct of a business, or (2) for the joint production, extraction, or use of 
property, but not for the purpose of selling services or property produced or extracted.  
Specifically, the commenter stated that it is unclear how parties jointly operating a 
renewable energy project can do so without conducting a business selling services or 
property produced (that is, selling electricity).
5
Another commenter asked for clarity on what a delegation of authority under 
§1.761-2(a)(3)(iii) would cover for a JOA of applicable credit property that produces 
electricity.  Section 1.761-2(a)(3)(iii) provides, in relevant part, that a participant to a 
JOA may delegate authority to sell its share of any property produced or extracted, but 
5
 The commenter also raised Rev. Proc. 2002-22, 2002-1 CB 733 (specifying the conditions under which 
the IRS will consider a request for a private letter ruling that an undivided fractional interest in rental real 
property is not an interest in a business entity), and noted that: “if the parties to a joint venture combine 
capital or services with the intent of conducting a business or enterprise and of sharing the profits and 
losses from the venture, a partnership (or other business entity) is created.”

not for a period in excess of the minimum needs of the industry, and in no event for 
more than one year.  This commenter also asked for examples of compliant JOAs that 
would allow electricity generated through the joint ownership of applicable credit 
property to be sold pursuant to a power purchase agreement.
Commenters also requested guidance permitting a single entity or taxpayer to 
handle the administrative affairs and day-to-day management activities of operating an 
applicable credit property on behalf of the other joint owners without impacting the 
owners’ ability to be properly excluded from the application of subchapter K.  One 
commenter stated that it would be useful to illustrate a range of JOAs likely to result in 
exclusion from the application of subchapter K and suggested that key elements of such 
fact patterns might include: an agreement to share revenues in proportion with the co-
owners’ respective ownership interests; an agreement to share revenues out of 
proportion with the co-owners’ respective ownership interests; an agreement in which 
rights to dispose of property or take other significant actions are reserved to a subset of 
the co-owners; and/or an agreement to receive debt financing based on the anticipation 
of funds expected to result from an elective payment election in a case in which the 
lender is not a co-owner.
A commenter stated that it would also be helpful to clarify the application of 
§1.761-2(a)(3)(iii) to co-ownership ventures in cases in which co-owners generate and 
sell power as a collective rather than on their separate accounts, or alternatively if the 
collective entity sells power to each of the participating co-owners and then those co-
owners sell power to third parties on their own accounts but the collective may sell 
some other services or property incidental to the activity for which the credit is 
determined.  This commenter highlighted that, in California and some other States, local 
government agencies often pool resources under a Joint Powers Authority (JPA).  The 
commenter asked that guidance clarify the conditions under which a JPA could be 

treated as an organization that has made a valid election under section 761(a) of the 
Code to be excluded from the application of subchapter K, including if the JPA is a 
separate legal entity and sells power under its own account.
One commenter stated that existing guidance allowing for clean energy 
arrangements to validly elect out of subchapter K, including through the use of TIC 
structures, is limited and should be updated.  This commenter stated that a partnership 
is defined in the Code and in the Treasury Regulations under sections 761 and 7701, 
but the distinction between an arrangement treated as a partnership for Federal tax 
purposes and one that has validly elected out of subchapter K, including a valid TIC, is 
not well defined in the energy generation context.  The commenter pointed out that pre-
IRA partnership guidance, including guidance allowing for the use of tax-equity 
partnership structures, is widely used as a basis for structuring projects within the 
renewable industry and is well understood.  However, existing guidance for 
arrangements in the energy generation context that will not be treated as a partnership 
for Federal tax purposes is limited and outdated.  The commenter urged the Treasury 
Department and the IRS to provide clear, updated, and timely guidance on clean energy 
arrangements that would not be treated as partnerships for Federal tax purposes.
The Treasury Department and the IRS agree that additional guidance is needed 
on joint ownership arrangements of applicable credit property that produce electricity 
that can be excluded from the application of subchapter K.  As a result, the Treasury 
Department and the IRS have proposed regulations in the Proposed Rules section of 
this edition of the Federal Register that would add certain exceptions to the 
requirements contained in the regulations under section 761(a) and provide an 
example.  These exceptions generally would allow any applicable entity described in 
section 6417(d)(1)(A) and §1.6417-1(c) that jointly owns applicable credit property that 
produces electricity to (1) own its interests through an entity (other than an entity 

required to be treated as a corporation under the Code) and (2) delegate its authority to 
an agent to sell its share of the electricity produced from such applicable credit property 
for a period of more than 1 year, provided that the delegation authority to the agent is 
not for more than 1 year.  See Election to Exclude Certain Unincorporated 
Organizations Owned by Applicable Entities from the Application of Subchapter K, 
REG-101552-24, in the Proposed Rules section of this edition of the Federal Register.
ii. Applying the undivided ownership interests rule to qualified property
One commenter requested some clarifying edits to address how proposed 
§1.6417-2(a)(1)(iii), the rule for undivided ownership interests, would operate with 
respect to a section 48E credit.  This commenter noted that proposed §1.6417-1(e)(12) 
defines “applicable credit property” for purposes of section 48E as “a qualified facility 
described in section 48E(b)(3);” however, section 48E(b) allows a section 48E credit to 
be claimed only with respect to a qualified investment in a qualified facility.  The 
commenter asked for clarification on what part of the qualified investment is owned by 
such joint tenant, and suggested adding language to the final regulations to clarify that 
an applicable entity should be able to claim applicable credits with respect to the 
applicable credit property in proportion to its share of qualified property.
The Treasury Department and the IRS agree with the commenter that a section 
48E credit is determined, in part, based on an applicable entity’s qualified investment 
with respect to a qualified facility, but do not believe that further language is needed 
because this concept is already covered in the language under proposed §1.6417-
2(a)(1)(iii), which provides that an applicable entity will be treated as owning a separate 
applicable credit property equal to its undivided ownership share.  An applicable entity’s 
undivided ownership share is determined under Federal income tax ownership 
principles and is outside the scope of these final regulations.  Thus, these final 
regulations do not adopt the commenter’s suggestion.

4. Partnerships
The proposed regulations would have provided that partnerships and 
S corporations are not applicable entities described in section 6417(d)(1)(A), but 
requested comments on whether any entity described in section 6417(d)(1)(A)(i) 
through (vi) or proposed §1.6417-1(c) could include an entity organized as a partnership 
or S corporation for Federal tax purposes.  No commenter stated that an entity 
described in section 6417(d)(1)(A)(i) through (vi) or proposed §1.6417-1(c) could 
include an entity organized as a partnership or S corporation for Federal tax purposes.  
Therefore, these final regulations adopt the rule as proposed.
Under the proposed regulations and these final regulations, a partnership or an 
S corporation is eligible to make the elective payment election only with respect to a 
section 45V credit, section 45Q credit, and section 45X credit (assuming all the other 
requirements to make the election with respect to these credits are met).  This rule 
applies no matter how many of the partners or shareholders are applicable entities 
described in section 6417(d)(1)(A) and §1.6417-1(c), including if all of the partners or 
shareholders are applicable entities described in section 6417(d)(1)(A) and §1.6417-
1(c).  However, as the proposed regulations noted, because section 6418(f)(2) defines 
“eligible taxpayer” for purposes of transfer eligibility as “any taxpayer which is not 
described in section 6417(d)(1)(A)” (and thus not in proposed §1.6417-1(c)), such a 
partnership or S corporation would be an eligible taxpayer described in section 
6418(f)(2) and may be eligible to transfer eligible credits.
6
A number of commenters requested that the final regulations allow applicable 
entities to make elective payment elections through an entity treated as a partnership 
6
 The Treasury Department and the IRS acknowledge that section 6418 does not contain a provision 
parallel to section 6417(d)(2) providing that section 50(b)(3) and (4)(A)(i) do not apply to limit the 
determination of a credit in section 6417.  Thus, section 50(b)(3) and (4)(A)(i) may limit eligible investment 
tax credits determined with respect to a partnership or S corporation with applicable entity partners or 
shareholders for purposes of section 6418.

for Federal tax purposes, either if all the partners in the partnership are applicable 
entities described in section 6417(d)(1)(A) or if at least one partner in the partnership is 
an applicable entity described in section 6417(d)(1)(A).  Commenters advocating for 
including partnerships composed entirely of applicable entities as an applicable entity 
stated that such a rule would help cover capital needs, diversify risk, and fill gaps in 
expertise between applicable entities.  Commenters advocating for mixed partnerships 
(that is, partnerships consisting of both applicable entities and entities that are not 
applicable entities) said that not allowing applicable entities to make elective payment 
elections for applicable credit property held through mixed partnerships would reduce 
economic incentives to invest in clean energy, undermining the objectives of the IRA.  
Several commenters stated that applicable entities lack the required resources to 
engage in green energy projects themselves and asked that the final regulations permit 
a partnership to make an elective payment election with respect to the portion of the 
underlying credits allocable to an applicable entity.  A few commenters stated that 
structures eligible to elect out of subchapter K have numerous requirements and 
complexities that limit their usefulness.  One commenter recommended that the final 
regulations either (1) allow a partnership to make an elective payment election on one 
hundred percent of the credits so long as the partnership is majority owned by an 
applicable entity, or (2) allow a partnership with majority applicable entity ownership to 
make an elective payment election on the portion of credits allocable to such applicable 
entities.
Based on the language in section 6417(c)(1) that treats a partnership as the 
owner of any applicable credit property held directly by the partnership and requires a 
partnership to make any elective payment election with respect to such property, these 
final regulations retain the proposed regulations’ entity view of partnerships under 
section 6417(c)(1).  Because an entity described in section 6417(d)(1)(A)(i) through (vi) 

or proposed §1.6417-1(c) does not include an entity treated as a partnership for Federal 
tax purposes (or as an S corporation), these final regulations do not adopt commenters’ 
suggestions and do not allow entities treated as partnerships for Federal tax purposes 
(or S corporations) to make elective payment elections, except with respect to a section 
45V credit, section 45Q credit, and section 45X credit.  However, these restrictions do 
not apply to entities, whether comprised of only applicable entities or comprised of a mix 
of applicable and non-applicable entities, that have made a valid election out of 
subchapter K under section 761(a), including through the exception for certain joint 
ownership arrangements of applicable credit property identified in the proposed 
regulations under section 761 described in part I.B.3.i of this Summary of Comments 
and Explanation of Revisions.
A few commenters asked that taxable entities be permitted to serve as an 
administrative member or manager of a State law entity to which an applicable entity 
owns all of the other interests without creating a partnership for Federal tax purposes, 
provided that such taxable entities do not receive distributive shares of partnership 
items or partnership distributions.  These final regulations do not attempt to establish 
any additional criteria by which a taxpayer can provide administrative or managerial 
services for an applicable entity without creating a partnership between the taxpayers 
for Federal tax purposes.  However, as previously described, the Treasury Department 
and the IRS are simultaneously issuing proposed regulations under section 761 in the 
Proposed Rules section of this edition of the Federal Register that provide additional 
guidance for certain renewable energy arrangements that can validly elect out of 
subchapter K.
Multiple commenters asked that the final regulations provide further clarity on 
Tribal entities and allow co-ownership of projects.  A few commenters asked that the 
final regulations allow Tribal Energy Development Organizations (TEDOs), or other 

wholly owned Tribal enterprises, to be applicable entities regardless of how they are 
chartered.  Some commenters asked that the final regulations allow tribes to form 
special purpose vehicles under an LLC structure to jointly own renewable energy 
projects and employ the distributive share rules for allocating the "applicable credit" to 
each LLC member, regardless of the tax status of that member.  Commenters also 
asked that inter-governmental partnerships, whether formed under State law such as 
JPAs, or formed under Tribal law as inter-tribal consortiums, should be eligible to make 
an elective payment election.
While it is possible that in certain cases a Tribal law entity (including a TEDO) 
and/or inter-governmental partnership could be an applicable entity, such a 
determination is outside the scope of these final regulations.  However, the Treasury 
Department and the IRS are actively working on guidance regarding the Federal tax 
status of Tribal law entities organized and controlled by tribes.  The Treasury 
Department and the IRS will not release final guidance in advance of additional Tribal 
consultation.
Commenters also stated that, if the Treasury Department and the IRS allow for 
section 6417 elections to be made on behalf of applicable entity partners, the final 
regulations should make conforming clarifications, including clarifying that the 
“applicable credit” that is reduced to zero under section 6417(e) is only the portion of the 
credit for which a section 6417 election has been made and clarifying the distributive 
share rules.  Because these final regulations do not allow section 6417 elections to be 
made on behalf of applicable entity partners, these final regulations do not adopt the 
suggested conforming changes.
5. Consolidated Groups
Proposed §1.6417-2(a)(1)(v) would have provided that, for members of a 
consolidated group (as defined in §1.1502-1) the common parent of which is an Alaska 

Native Corporation, any member that is an electing taxpayer may make an elective 
payment election with respect to applicable credits determined with respect to the 
member.  Proposed §1.6417-2(a)(2)(vi) would have provided the same rule with respect 
to electing taxpayers.  See §1.1502-77 (providing rules regarding the status of the 
common parent as agent for its members).  The proposed regulations would also have 
provided that a member of a consolidated group is required to complete pre-filing 
registration as a condition of, and prior to, making an elective payment election.
The preamble to the proposed regulations stated that an ANC may be the 
common parent of a consolidated group of corporations (ANC-parented group) and 
noted that some stakeholders had inquired whether non-ANC members of an ANC-
parented group may separately make an elective payment election with respect to a 
section 45V credit, section 45Q credit, or section 45X credit determined with respect to 
such member.  In response, the preamble to the proposed regulations stated that a non-
ANC member of an ANC-parented group may qualify as an electing taxpayer eligible to 
make elections under section 6417(d)(1)(B), (C), or (D), based on its own corporate 
status.  See §1.1502-80(a).  As with any other electing taxpayer, a non-ANC member of 
an ANC-parented group would be required to complete pre-filing registration (as would 
be required under proposed §1.6417-5) and must make its elective payment election 
under section 6417(d)(1)(B), (C), or (D) with respect to an applicable section 45V credit, 
section 45Q credit, or section 45X credit determined with respect to the member.  See 
§1.1502-77 (providing rules regarding the status of the common parent as agent for its 
members).
The preamble to the proposed regulations requested comments (1) regarding the 
definition in proposed §1.6417-1(c)(4) and whether additional guidance is necessary 
regarding consolidated groups with ANC common parents; (2) whether additional 
guidance is necessary to address any uncertainty that may exist regarding the 

application of section 6417 in the context of a consolidated group with members that are 
cooperatives subject to the rules of subchapter T of chapter 1; and (3) regarding the 
application of section 6417 to consolidated groups with electing taxpayers (for example, 
whether special rules are necessary for consolidated groups to apply the “denial of 
double benefit” rule under proposed §1.6417-2(e)(2)).
No commenter addressed these issues relating to ANCs.  However, the Treasury 
Department and the IRS have determined that the text of proposed §1.6417-2(a)(1)(v), 
which referred to consolidated groups “of which an Alaska Native Corporation is the 
common parent,” was too limiting and should apply to any consolidated group with an 
applicable entity parent.  Therefore, these final regulations expand the definition by 
removing the specific reference to Alaska Native Corporations in §1.6417-2(a)(1)(v) and 
broaden the rule to apply to any consolidated group of which an applicable entity is the 
common parent.
A few commenters requested confirmation that the “entity-specific” rules of 
section 6417 apply to an elective payment election made by a partnership that has as 
its only partners two or more members of the same consolidated group and suggested 
an example confirming the treatment.  The commenters wanted confirmation that the 
election would be made by the partnership, as required by section 6417(c)(1) and 
proposed §1.6417-4(a), rather than by the partnership’s members, as provided in 
proposed §1.6417-2(a)(2)(vi).  The Treasury Department and the IRS agree that any 
entity treated as a partnership for Federal tax purposes, and not any of its partners 
(regardless of the identity or Federal tax status of the partners), would make an elective 
payment election with respect to section 45Q credits, section 45V credits, or section 
45X credits pursuant to section 6417(c)(1) and §1.6417-4(a), but disagree that an 
example illustrating this point is needed.
6. Pooled Investment Vehicles

The proposed regulations did not provide a special rule for employee plans that 
are subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) if they 
choose to invest through pooled investment vehicles, whether the vehicles are 
organized as partnerships or otherwise.  One commenter stated that ERISA plans 
typically make investments through pooled investment vehicles, which often are 
organized as limited partnerships or LLCs, and take minority interests in them in order 
to avoid subjecting the vehicles to fiduciary, prohibited transaction, and other rules 
under ERISA's "plan asset'' rules.  The commenter believed that, if pooled investment 
vehicles are not considered to be applicable entities, then employee plans generally 
cannot benefit from elective payment elections under section 6417 with respect to some 
or all of the applicable credits listed in section 6417(b).  The commenter suggested that 
ERISA plan fiduciaries might choose not to invest in applicable credit activities at all.  
The commenter requested that the final regulations provide a mechanism by which 
ERISA plan investors indirectly investing through pooled investment vehicles can make 
an elective payment election.
The Treasury Department and the IRS understand the commenter’s concern that 
ERISA plans may be discouraged from investing in certain entities engaged in 
applicable credit activities under the proposed regulations.  Other applicable entities 
have similar concerns that investments in certain entities engaged in applicable credit 
activities under the proposed regulations will not be investments in applicable entities.  
While there are rules outside of these final regulations that may impact how ERISA 
plans make investments, there is no indication in section 6417 that ERISA plans can or 
should be subject to rules different than those that apply to other applicable entities.  
Thus, these final regulations do not provide a special rule for ERISA plans investing in 
pooled investment vehicles that would allow ERISA plans to be eligible to make an 
elective payment election if investing through a partnership structure.

II. Rules for Making Elective Payment Elections
A. In general
Proposed §1.6417-2 would have provided general rules for an applicable entity 
or electing taxpayer to make an elective payment election under section 6417 with 
respect to any applicable credit determined with respect to such entity.  Commenters 
addressed many aspects of these proposed rules, which are discussed in this part II of 
the Summary of Comments and Explanation of Revisions.  These final regulations 
adopt the rules as proposed, with the modifications described in this part II.
B. Manner of making the election
Section 6417(a) provides that the elective payment election is made “at such 
time and in such manner as the Secretary may provide,” and proposed §1.6417-2(b) 
would have provided the particular requirements for properly and timely making the 
election.
1. Return Requirements
Proposed §1.6417-2(b)(1)(i) would have provided that an applicable entity makes 
an elective payment election on the applicable entity’s or electing taxpayer’s annual tax 
return, as defined in proposed §1.6417-1(b), in the manner prescribed by the IRS in 
guidance, along with any required completed source credit form(s) with respect to the 
applicable credit property, a completed Form 3800, General Business Credit (or its 
successor), and any additional information, including supporting calculations, required in 
instructions to the relevant forms.
To avoid any confusion about how the elective payment election should be 
made, proposed §1.6417-1(b) would have defined “annual tax return,” for purposes of 
the section 6417 regulations, as follows: (1) for any taxpayer normally required to file an 
annual tax return with the IRS, such annual return (including the Form 1065, U.S. 
Return of Partnership Income, for partnerships and the Form 990-T, Exempt 

Organization Business Income Tax Return (and proxy tax under section 6033(e)), for 
organizations with unrelated business income tax or a proxy tax under section 6033(e)); 
(2) for any taxpayer that is not normally required to file an annual tax return with the IRS 
(such as taxpayers located in the U.S. territories), the return they would be required to 
file if they were located in the United States, or, if no such return is required (such as for 
a State; the District of Columbia; or local or Indian tribal governments), the Form 990-T; 
and (3) for taxpayers filing a return for a taxable year of less than 12 months (short 
year), the short year tax return.  These final regulations make minor, nonsubstantive 
edits to the definition in the proposed regulations to avoid using the phrase annual tax 
return in defining the term.
Several commenters requested that the IRS use a new or different form than 
Form 990-T or revise certain forms (including Forms 990, 990-T, 1120, 3468, 3800, 
8038-CP, and 8911).  Several commenters also requested a detailed list of the 
documents required to complete the filing process, information on how to complete 
required forms, or reduced information requirements for filers who had previously not 
been required to file any returns with the IRS.
The Treasury Department and the IRS recognize that some taxpayers may not 
have experience or a historical filing obligation and will consider providing simplified 
instructions or the need for a new form in future years.  The Treasury Department and 
IRS are committed to developing educational and outreach tools to assist tribes, 
government entities, their instrumentalities, and exempt organizations to complete the 
forms required solely to make an elective payment election.  It is outside of the scope of 
these final regulations to address comments related to individual forms or the kind of 
documentation that may be required to complete those forms.  Thus, these final 
regulations adopt the rules as proposed.
Several commenters requested confirmation that, for those taxpayers that 

normally file the Form 1120 with the IRS, the Form 1120 can be used to make the 
elective payment election.  The Treasury Department and the IRS confirm that this is 
the intent of the language in §1.6417-1(b)(1), which states “[f]or any taxpayer normally 
required to file an annual tax return with the IRS, such annual return,” and have added 
the Form 1120, as well as other examples of annual tax forms, to the parenthetical.
Other commenters requested that the elective payment election could be made 
on the Form 1120-W.  As the Form 1120-W is not an annual income tax return, these 
final regulations do not adopt that suggestion.
2. Original Return Requirements
Proposed §1.6417-2(b)(1)(ii) would have provided that an elective payment 
election must be made on an original return (including any revisions on a superseding 
return) filed not later than the due date (including extensions of time) for the original 
return for the taxable year for which the applicable credit is determined.  The proposed 
regulations stated that no elective payment election may be made “or revised” on an 
amended return or by filing an administrative adjustment request (AAR) under section 
6227 of the Code.  The proposed regulations also did not provide for relief under 
§301.9100-1 through 301.9100-3 (9100 relief) for an elective payment election that is 
not timely filed.
Multiple commenters asked that an elective payment election be permitted on an 
amended return or AAR and/or that a taxpayer be permitted an extension of time under 
the 9100 relief procedures to make a late election.  Commenters stated that not allowing 
a late election is an unreasonable result for new market entrants and creates significant 
barriers for entities with limited resources.  Some commenters recommended that 
applicable entities should be allowed to make the elective payment election on late 
returns and also be able to claim a six-month automatic extension of time to file the 
election under §301.9100-2(b).  Commenters requested that the final regulations 

provide some form of relief for taxpayers that acted in good faith and made a 
reasonable effort in complying, particularly for new filers who may not have had a prior 
filing obligation.  Commenters further suggested that providing additional time to make 
an election would increase market participation and promote equity.
In response to these comments, these final regulations remove the words “or 
revised” in §1.6417-2(b)(1)(ii) and provide “[n]o elective payment election may be made 
for the first time on an amended return, withdrawn on an amended return, or made or 
withdrawn by filing an administrative adjustment request under section 6227, although a 
numerical error with respect to a properly claimed elective payment election may be 
corrected on an amended return or by filing an administrative adjustment request under 
section 6227 if necessary.”  This clarification is intended to address situations in which a 
taxpayer intended to make an elective payment election but made a reporting error with 
respect to an element of a valid election (for example, miscalculating the amount of the 
credit on the original return or making a typographical error in the process of inputting a 
registration number), and to allow the taxpayer to correct any errors that would result in 
a disallowance of the election or to correct an excessive payment before an excessive 
payment determination is made by the IRS.  Consistently, it is appropriate to allow 
taxpayers to correct errors that would result in a larger payment than indicated on the 
original return as long as such larger amount is accurate.  This provision cannot be 
used to revoke an election or to make an election for the first time on an amended 
return.  In addition, the taxpayer’s original return, which must be signed under penalties 
of perjury, must contain all of the information, including a registration number, required 
by these final regulations.  To properly correct an error on an amended return or AAR, a 
taxpayer must have made an error in the information included on the original return 
such that there is a substantive item to correct; a taxpayer cannot correct a blank item 
or an item that is described as being “available upon request.”
