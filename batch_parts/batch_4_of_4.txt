ection 202 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA) requires that 
agencies assess anticipated costs and benefits and take certain other actions before 
issuing a final rule that includes any Federal mandate that may result in expenditures in 
any one year by a State, local, or Indian tribal government, in the aggregate, or by the 
private sector, of $100 million (updated annually for inflation).  These final regulations 
do not include any Federal mandate that may result in expenditures by State, local, or 
Indian tribal governments, or by the private sector in excess of that threshold.
V. Executive Order 13132:  Federalism
Executive Order 13132 (Federalism) prohibits an agency from publishing any rule 
that has federalism implications if the rule either imposes substantial, direct compliance 
costs on State and local governments, and is not required by statute, or preempts State 
law, unless the agency meets the consultation and funding requirements of section 6 of 
the Executive Order.  These final regulations do not have federalism implications and do 
not impose substantial direct compliance costs on State and local governments or 
preempt State law within the meaning of the Executive Order.
VI. Executive Order 13175: Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal 
Governments
Executive Order 13175 (Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal 
Governments) prohibits an agency from publishing any rule that has Tribal implications 
if the rule either imposes substantial, direct compliance costs on Indian tribal 
governments, and is not required by statute, or preempts Tribal law, unless the agency 

meets the consultation and funding requirements of section 5 of the Executive Order.  
These final regulations do not have substantial direct effects on one or more federally 
recognized Indian tribes and do not impose substantial direct compliance costs on 
Indian tribal governments within the meaning of the Executive Order.
Nevertheless, on July 17, 2023, the Treasury Department and the IRS held a 
consultation with Tribal leaders requesting assistance in addressing questions related to 
the proposed rules published on June 21, 2023, which informed the development of 
these final regulations.
VII. Congressional Review Act
Pursuant to the Congressional Review Act (5 U.S.C. 801 et seq.), the Office of 
Information and Regulatory Affairs designated this rule as a major rule as defined by 5 
U.S.C. 804(2).

manner.
§1.6417-2 Rules for making elective payment elections.
(a) Elective payment elections--(1) Elections by applicable entities--(i) In general.  
An applicable entity that makes an elective payment election in the manner provided in 
paragraph (b) of this section will be treated as making a payment against the Federal 
income taxes imposed by subtitle A for the taxable year with respect to which an 
applicable credit is determined in the amount determined under paragraph (c) of this 
section.

(ii) Disregarded entities.  If an applicable entity is the owner (directly or indirectly) 
of a disregarded entity that directly holds an applicable credit property, the applicable 
entity may make an elective payment election in the manner provided in paragraph (b) 
of this section for applicable credits determined with respect to the applicable credit 
property held directly by the disregarded entity.
(iii) Undivided ownership interests.  If an applicable entity is a co-owner in an 
applicable credit property through an arrangement properly treated as a tenancy-in-
common for Federal income tax purposes, or through an organization that has made a 
valid election under section 761(a) of the Code to be excluded from the application of 
subchapter K of the Code, then the applicable entity’s undivided ownership share of the 
applicable credit property will be treated as a separate applicable credit property owned 
by such applicable entity, and the applicable entity may make an elective payment 
election in the manner provided in paragraph (b) of this section for the applicable credits 
determined with respect to such applicable credit property.
(iv) Partnerships and S corporations not applicable entities.  Partnerships and 
S corporations are not applicable entities described in §1.6417-1(c), and thus are not 
eligible to make any election under paragraph (b) of this section, unless the partnership 
or S corporation is an electing taxpayer.  This is the case no matter how many of the 
partners of a partnership are described in §1.6417-1(c), including if all of a partnership’s 
partners are so described.
(v) Members of a consolidated group of which an applicable entity is the common 
parent.  In the case of a consolidated group (as defined in §1.1502-1) the common 
parent of which is an applicable entity, any member that is an electing taxpayer may 
make an elective payment election with respect to applicable credits determined with 
respect to the member.  See §1.1502-77 (providing rules regarding the status of the 
common parent as agent for its members).

(2) Electing taxpayers--(i) Electing taxpayers that are not partnerships or 
S corporations.  An electing taxpayer other than a partnership or an S corporation that 
has made an elective payment election in accordance with §1.6417-3 and paragraph (b) 
of this section will be treated as making a payment against the Federal income taxes 
imposed by subtitle A of the Code for the taxable year with respect to which the 
applicable credit is determined, in the amount determined under paragraph (c) of this 
section.
(ii) Electing taxpayers that are partnerships or S corporations.  In the case of an 
electing taxpayer that is a partnership or S corporation that has made an elective 
payment election in accordance with §§1.6417-3 and 1.6417-4 and paragraph (b) of this 
section, the Internal Revenue Service will make a payment to such partnership or 
S corporation equal to the amount of such credit determined under paragraph (c) of this 
section and §1.6417-4(d) (unless the partnership owes any Federal income tax liability, 
in which case the payment may be reduced by such tax liability).
(iii) Partners and S corporation shareholders prohibited from making any elective 
payment election.  Under section 6417(c)(1) of the Code, any elective payment election 
with respect to applicable credit property held directly by a partnership or S corporation 
must be made by the partnership or S corporation.  As provided under section 
6417(c)(2), no partner in a partnership, or shareholder of an S corporation, may make 
an elective payment election with respect to any applicable credit determined with 
respect to such applicable credit property.
(iv) Disregarded entities.  If an electing taxpayer is the owner (directly or 
indirectly) of a disregarded entity that directly holds any applicable credit property, the 
electing taxpayer may make an elective payment election in the manner provided in 
paragraph (b) of this section for applicable credits determined with respect to the 
applicable credit property held directly by the disregarded entity.

(v) Undivided ownership interests.  If an electing taxpayer is a co-owner in an 
applicable credit property through an arrangement properly treated as a tenancy-in-
common for Federal income tax purposes, or through an organization that has made a 
valid election under section 761(a) to be excluded from the application of subchapter K 
of the Code, then the electing taxpayer's undivided ownership interest in or share of the 
applicable credit property will be treated as a separate applicable credit property owned 
by such electing taxpayer, and the electing taxpayer may make an elective payment 
election in the manner provided in paragraph (b) of this section for the applicable credits 
determined with respect to such applicable credit property.
(vi) Members of a consolidated group.  A member of a consolidated group may 
make an elective payment election with respect to applicable credits determined with 
respect to the member. See §1.1502-77 (providing rules regarding the status of the 
common parent as agent for its members).
(3) Special rules for certain credits—(i) Renewable electricity production credit.  
Any election under this paragraph (a) with respect to a section 45 credit—
(A) Applies separately with respect to each qualified facility;
(B) Must be made in the manner provided in paragraph (b) of this section for the 
taxable year in which such qualified facility is originally placed in service; and 
(C) Applies to such taxable year and to any subsequent taxable year that is 
within the period described in section 45(a)(2)(A)(ii) with respect to such qualified 
facility.
(ii) Credit for carbon oxide sequestration.  Except as provided in §1.6417-3(c), 
which provides a special rule for electing taxpayers, any election under this paragraph 
(a) with respect to a section 45Q credit--
(A) Applies separately with respect to the carbon capture equipment originally 
placed in service by the applicable entity during a taxable year;

(B) Must be made in the manner provided in paragraph (b) of this section for the 
taxable year in which such carbon capture equipment is originally placed in service; and
(C) Applies to such taxable year and to any subsequent taxable year that is 
within the period described in section 45Q(3)(A) or (4)(A) with respect to such 
equipment.
(iii) Credit for production of clean hydrogen.  Except as provided in §1.6417-3(b), 
which provides a special rule for electing taxpayers, any election under this paragraph 
(a) with respect to a section 45V credit--
(A) Applies separately with respect to each qualified clean hydrogen production 
facility;
(B) Must be made in the manner provided in paragraph (b) of this section for the 
taxable year in which such facility is placed in service (or within the 1-year period after 
August 16, 2022, for facilities placed in service before December 31, 2022); and
(C) Applies to such taxable year and all subsequent taxable years with respect to 
such facility.
(iv) Clean electricity production credit.  Any elective payment election with 
respect to a section 45Y credit--
(A) Applies separately with respect to each qualified facility;
(B) Must be made in the manner provided in paragraph (b) of this section for the 
taxable year in which such facility is placed in service; and
(C) Applies to such taxable year and to any subsequent taxable year that is 
within the period described in section 45Y(b)(1)(B) with respect to such facility.
(v) Advanced manufacturing production credit.  Any elective payment election 
with respect to a section 45X credit applies separately with respect to each facility 
(whether the facility existed on or before, or after, December 31, 2022) at which a 
taxpayer produces, after December 31, 2022, eligible components (as defined in section 

45X(c)(1)) during the taxable year.
(b) Manner of making election--(1) In general--(i) Election is made on the annual 
tax return.  An elective payment election is made on the annual tax return, as defined in 
§1.6417-1(b), in the manner prescribed by the IRS in guidance, along with any required 
completed source credit form(s) with respect to the applicable credit property, a 
completed Form 3800, General Business Credit, (or its successor), and any additional 
information, including supporting calculations, required in instructions.
(ii) Election must be made on original return.  An election must be made on an 
original return (including any revisions on a superseding return) filed not later than the 
due date (including extensions of time) for the original return for the taxable year for 
which the applicable credit is determined.  No elective payment election may be made 
for the first time on an amended return, withdrawn on an amended return, or made or 
withdrawn by filing an administrative adjustment request under section 6227 of the 
Code.  A numerical error with respect to a properly claimed elective payment election 
may be corrected on an amended return or by filing an administrative adjustment 
request under section 6227 if necessary; however, the applicable entity or electing 
taxpayer’s original return, which must be signed under penalties of perjury, must contain 
all of the information, including a registration number, required by these final 
regulations.  To properly correct an error on an amended return or administrative 
adjustment request under section 6227, an applicable entity or electing taxpayer must 
have made an error in the information included on the original return such that there is a 
substantive item to correct; an applicable entity or electing taxpayer may not correct a 
blank item or an item that is described as being “available upon request.”  There is no 
relief available under §301.9100-1 or §301.9100-3 of this chapter for an elective 
payment election that is not timely filed; however, relief under §301.9100-2(b) may 
apply if the applicable entity or electing taxpayer has not received an extension of time 

to file a return after the original due date, has timely filed a return, takes corrective 
action under §301.9100-2(c) within the six-month extension period, and meets the 
procedural requirements outlined in §301.9100-2(d).
(2) Pre-filing registration required.  Pre-filing registration in accordance with 
§1.6417-5 is a condition for making an elective payment election.  An elective payment 
election will not be effective with respect to credits determined with respect to an 
applicable credit property unless the applicable entity or electing taxpayer received a 
valid registration number for the applicable credit property in accordance with §1.6417-
5(c) and provided the registration number for each applicable credit property on its Form 
3800 (or its successor), and on any required completed source form(s) with respect to 
the applicable credit property, attached to the tax return, in accordance with guidance.
(3) Due date for making the election.  To be effective, an elective payment 
election must be made no later than:
(i) In the case of any taxpayer for which no Federal income tax return is required 
under sections 6011 or no Federal return is required under 6033(a) of the Code (such 
as a State; the District of Columbia; an Indian Tribal government; any U.S. territory; a 
political subdivision of a State, the District of Columbia, or a U.S. territory, or a 
subdivision of an Indian Tribal government; certain agencies or instrumentalities of a 
State, the District of Columbia, an Indian Tribal government, or a U.S. territory; or a 
taxpayer excluded from filing pursuant to section 6033(a)(3)), the 15th day of the fifth 
month after the end of the taxable year.  For purposes of section 6417, an applicable 
entity that is not required to file a Federal income tax return pursuant to sections 6011 
or a Federal return pursuant to 6033(a), but is filing solely to make an elective payment 
election, may choose whether to file its first return (and thus adopt a taxable year for 
purposes of section 6417) based upon a calendar or fiscal year, provided that such 
entity maintains adequate book and records, including a reconciliation of any difference 

between its regular books of account and its chosen taxable year, to support making an 
elective payment election on the basis of its chosen taxable year.  Subject to issuance 
of guidance that specifies the manner in which an entity for which no Federal income 
tax return is required under sections 6011 or no Federal return is required pursuant to 
6033(a) could request an extension of time to file and make the elective payment 
election, an automatic paperless six-month extension from the 15th day of the fifth 
month after the end of the taxable year is deemed to be allowed.
(ii) In the case of any taxpayer located in a U.S. territory, the due date (including 
extensions of time) that would apply if the taxpayer were located in the United States.
(iii) In any other case, the due date (including extensions of time) for the original 
return for the taxable year for which the election is made, but in no event earlier than 
February 13, 2023.
(4) Election is not revocable—(i) In general.  Except as provided in paragraphs 
(b)(4)(ii) and (iii) of this section, any elective payment election, once made, is 
irrevocable and applies with respect to any applicable credit for the taxable year for 
which the election is made.
(ii) Election lasts for a period of years for certain credits.  For applicable entities 
making elective payment elections with respect to section 45 credits described in 
§1.6417-1(d)(2) or section 45Y credits described in §1.6417-1(d)(8), the election applies 
to each taxable year in the 10-year period provided in section 45(a)(2)(A)(ii) or 
45Y(b)(1)(B), respectively, beginning on the date the facility was originally placed in 
service.  For applicable entities making elective payment elections with respect to 
section 45Q credits described in §1.6417-1(d)(3), the election applies to each taxable 
year in the 12-year period provided in section 45Q(a)(3)(A) or (4)(A) beginning on the 
date the carbon capture equipment was originally placed in service.  For applicable 
entities making elective payment elections with respect to section 45V credits described 

in §1.6417-1(d)(5), the election applies to the taxable year in which the qualified clean 
hydrogen production facility was originally placed in service and all subsequent taxable 
years.
(iii) Electing taxpayers.  For electing taxpayers who make an elective payment 
election, the election applies for one five-year period per applicable credit property, but 
such election may be revoked once per applicable credit property, as provided in 
§1.6417-3.
(5) Scope of election.  An elective payment election applies to the entire amount 
of applicable credit(s) determined with respect to each applicable credit property that 
was properly registered for the taxable year, resulting in an elective payment amount 
that is the entire amount of applicable credit(s) determined with respect to the applicable 
entity or electing taxpayer for a taxable year.
(c) Determination of applicable credit--(1) In general.  In the case of any 
applicable entity making an elective payment election, any applicable credit is 
determined--
(i) Without regard to section 50(b)(3) and (4)(A)(i) of the Code, and
(ii) By treating any property with respect to which such credit is determined as 
used in a trade or business of the applicable entity.
(2) Effect of trade or business rule.  The trade or business rule in paragraph 
(c)(1)(ii) of this section--
(i) Allows the applicable entity to treat an item of property as if it is: of a character 
subject to an allowance of depreciation (such as under sections 30C and 45W); one for 
which depreciation (or amortization in lieu of depreciation) is allowable (such as in 
sections 48, 48C, and 48E); and used to produce items in the ordinary course of a trade 
or business of the taxpayer (such as in sections 45V and 45X);
(ii) Allows the applicable entity to apply the capitalization and accelerated 

depreciation rules (such as sections 167, 168, 263, 263A, and 266 of the Code) that 
apply to determining the basis and the depreciation allowance for property used in a 
trade or business;
(iii) Makes applicable those credit limitations generally applicable to persons 
engaged in the conduct of a trade or business, such as section 49 of the Code in the 
context of investment tax credits and section 469 of the Code for all applicable credits;
(iv) Does not create any presumption that the trade or business is related (or 
unrelated) to a tax-exempt entity’s exempt purpose; and
(v) Subjects the applicable entity to the credit limitation in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of 
this section.
(3) Special rule for investment-related credit property acquired with amounts, 
including income from certain grants and forgivable loans, that are exempt from 
taxation--(i) Amounts included in basis.  Subject to paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, for 
purposes of section 6417, amounts that are exempt from taxation under subtitle A or 
otherwise excluded from taxation (such as income from certain grants and forgivable 
loans), and used to purchase, construct, reconstruct, erect, or otherwise acquire an 
applicable credit property described in section 30C, 45W, 48, 48C, or 48E (investment-
related credit property) are included in basis for purposes of computing the applicable 
credit amount determined with respect to the applicable credit property, regardless of 
whether basis is required to be reduced (in whole or in part) by such amounts under 
general tax principles.
(ii) No excess benefit from restricted tax exempt amounts.  If an applicable entity 
receives a grant, forgivable loan, or other income exempt from taxation under subtitle A 
or otherwise excluded from taxation (tax exempt amount) for the specific purpose of 
purchasing, constructing, reconstructing, erecting, or otherwise acquiring an investment-
related credit property (restricted tax exempt amount), and the sum of any restricted tax 

exempt amounts plus the applicable credit otherwise determined with respect to that 
investment-related credit property exceeds the cost of the investment-related credit 
property, then the amount of the applicable credit is reduced so that the total amount of 
applicable credit plus the amount of any restricted tax exempt amounts equals the cost 
of investment-related credit property.  The determination of whether a tax exempt grant 
is made for the specific purpose of purchasing, constructing, reconstructing, erecting, or 
otherwise acquiring an investment-related credit property is made at the time the grant 
is awarded to the applicable entity.  A tax exempt grant awarded after the investment-
related credit property is purchased, constructed, reconstructed, erected, or otherwise 
acquired is generally not a restricted tax exempt amount unless approval of the grant 
was perfunctory and the amount of the grant was virtually assured at the time of 
application.  The determination of whether a loan is made for the specific purpose of 
purchasing, constructing, reconstructing, erecting, or otherwise acquiring an investment-
related credit property and whether forgiveness of that loan is dependent on satisfying 
that specific purpose is made at the time the loan is approved.  This paragraph does not 
apply if a tax exempt amount is not received for the specific purpose of purchasing, 
constructing, reconstructing, erecting, or otherwise acquiring a property eligible for an 
investment-related credit; for example, if the tax exempt amount is from the 
organization’s general funds or if such amount’s use is not restricted to the purpose of 
purchasing, constructing, reconstructing, erecting, or otherwise acquiring an investment-
related credit property (such as purchasing an electric vehicle) and could be used for 
any of several different applicable credit properties (such as purchasing an electric 
vehicle or purchasing solar panels) or can be put to other purposes (such as purchasing 
an electric vehicle or making a building more energy efficient).
(4) Credits must be determined with respect to the applicable entity or electing 
taxpayer.  Any credits for which an elective payment election is made must have been 

determined with respect to the applicable entity or electing taxpayer.  An applicable 
credit is determined with respect to an applicable entity or electing taxpayer if the 
applicable entity or electing taxpayer owns the underlying applicable credit property and 
conducts the activities giving rise to the credit or, in the case of section 45X (under 
which ownership of applicable credit property is not required), to be considered (under 
the section 45X regulations) the taxpayer with respect to which the section 45X credit is 
determined.  Thus, no election may be made under this section for any credits 
transferred pursuant to section 6418, allowed pursuant to section 45Q(f)(3), acquired by 
a lessee from a lessor by means of an election to pass through the credit to a lessee 
under former section 48(d) (pursuant to section 50(d)(5)), owned by a third party, or 
otherwise not determined with respect to the applicable entity or electing taxpayer.
(5) Examples.  The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (c).
(i) Example 1.  School district A receives a tax exempt grant in the amount of 
$400,000 from the Environmental Protection Agency to purchase electric school bus B.  
The grant is a restricted tax exempt amount described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this 
section. A purchases B for $400,000.  Pursuant to paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, A’s 
basis in B is $400,000.  B qualifies for the maximum section 45W credit, $40,000.  
However, because the amount of the restricted tax exempt grant plus the amount of the 
section 45W credit exceeds the cost of B, the no excess benefit rule found in paragraph 
(c)(3)(ii) of this section applies.  A’s section 45W credit is reduced by the amount 
necessary so that the total amount of the section 45W credit plus the restricted tax 
exempt amount equals the cost of B.  A’s section 45W credit is therefore reduced by 
$40,000 to zero.
(ii) Example 2.  Assume the same facts as in paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section 
(Example 1), except that the grant is in the amount of $300,000.  This grant is still a 
restricted tax exempt amount described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section.  A 
purchases B using the grant and $100,000 of A’s unrestricted funds.  A’s basis in B is 
still $400,000 and A’s section 45W credit is $40,000.  Since the amount of the restricted 
tax exempt amount plus the amount of the section 45W credit ($340,000) is less than 
the cost of B, A’s 45W credit under section 6417(b)(6) is not subject to the no excess 
benefit rule found in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section.
(iii) Example 3.  Public charity B receives a $60,000 grant from a private 
foundation to build energy property, P, a qualified investment credit property that costs 
$80,000.  The $60,000 grant is a restricted tax exempt amount described in paragraph 
(c)(3)(ii) of this section.  B uses $20,000 of its own funds plus the $60,000 grant to build 
P.  Pursuant to paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, B’s basis in P is $80,000.  Assume 
that, based upon acquisition cost, B can earn a section 48 investment credit (with bonus 
credit amounts) of $40,000 (50% of basis).  However, because the amount of the 

restricted tax exempt amount ($60,000) plus the section 48 credit ($40,000) exceeds 
P’s cost by $20,000, the no excess benefit rule found in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this 
section applies to reduce B’s section 48 applicable credit by $20,000 so that the total 
amount of the section 48 investment credit plus the restricted tax exempt amount equals 
the cost of P.
(iv) Example 4.  The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development 
annually provides Capital Funds to Public Housing Agencies (PHAs) for the 
development, financing, and modernization of public housing developments and for 
management improvements.  Public Housing Authority H uses its annual allotment of 
Capital Funds to purchase rooftop solar panels for its property and to pay for the related 
equipment and labor to install the panels. These purchases are considered among the 
list of eligible uses, but are not the exclusive uses, of H’s Capital Funds.  Although the 
Capital Funds are exempt from taxation under subtitle A and used to purchase, 
construct, reconstruct, erect, or otherwise acquire an investment-related credit property, 
pursuant to paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, they are included in basis for purposes of 
computing the applicable credit amount determined with respect to the applicable credit 
property.  In addition, because the Capital Funds were not given for the specific purpose 
of purchasing, constructing, reconstructing, erecting, or otherwise acquiring an 
investment-related credit property, they are not considered restricted tax exempt 
amounts and the no excess benefit rule found in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section does 
not apply.
(v) Example 5.  Taxpayer Q is engaged in the business of capturing carbon 
oxide.  Q properly elects to be treated as an applicable entity with respect to the section 
45Q credit determined with respect to single process trains A, B, and C for 2024.  In the 
same year, Q also purchases section 45Q credits under section 6418 from an unrelated 
taxpayer and has section 45Q credits allowed to itself pursuant to section 45Q(f)(3).  Q 
can make an elective payment election only with respect to section 45Q applicable 
credits determined with respect to A, B, and C.  Q cannot make an elective payment 
election with respect to any credits transferred to Q pursuant to section 6418 or allowed 
to Q pursuant to section 45Q(f)(3).
(d) Timing of payment.  Except as provided in §1.6417-4(d) (relating to payments 
to partnerships and S corporations), the elective payment amount will be treated as 
made--
(1) In the case of any taxpayer for which no Federal income tax return is required 
under section 6011 or no Federal return is required under 6033(a), on the later of—
(i) The date that is the 15th day of the fifth month after the end of the taxable 
year, or 
(ii) The date on which such taxpayer submits a claim for credit or refund in 
accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.
(2) In any other case, on the later of—

(i) The due date (determined without regard to extensions) of the return for the 
taxable year, or 
(ii) The date on which such return is filed.
(e) Denial of double benefit--(1) In general.  Under section 6417(e), in the case of 
an applicable entity or electing taxpayer making an elective payment election with 
respect to an applicable credit, such credit is reduced to zero and is, for any other 
purposes of the Code, deemed to have been allowed as a credit to such entity or 
taxpayer for such taxable year.  Paragraph (e)(2) and (3) of this section explain the 
application of the section 6417(e) denial of double benefit rule to an applicable entity or 
electing taxpayer (other than a partnership or S corporation).  The application of section 
6417(e) for an electing taxpayer that is a partnership or S corporation is provided in 
§1.6417-4(c)(1)(ii).
(2) Application of the denial of double benefit rule.  An applicable entity or 
electing taxpayer (other than an electing taxpayer that is a partnership or S corporation) 
making an elective payment election applies section 6417(e) by taking the following 
steps:
(i) Compute the amount of the Federal income tax liability (if any) for the taxable 
year, without regard to the general business credit allowed by section 38 of the Code 
(GBC), that is payable on the due date of the return (without regard to extensions), and 
the amount of the Federal income tax liability that may be offset by GBCs pursuant to 
the limitation based on amount of tax under section 38.
(ii) Compute the allowed amount of GBC carryforwards carried to the taxable 
year under section 38(a)(1) plus the amount of current year GBCs (including current 
applicable credits) for the taxable year under section 38(a)(2) and (b).  Because the 
election is made on an original return for the taxable year for which the applicable credit 
is determined, any business credit carrybacks are not considered in determining the 

elective payment amount for the taxable year.
(iii) Calculate the net elective payment amount for all applicable credits, which 
equals the lesser of the sum of all applicable credits for which an elective payment 
election is made or the excess (if any, otherwise the excess is zero) of the total GBC 
credits described in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section over the amount of the Federal 
income tax liability that may be offset by GBCs pursuant to the limitation based on 
amount of tax under section 38 computed in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section.  Treat 
the net elective payment amount of all applicable credits for which an elective payment 
election is made as a payment against the tax imposed by subtitle A for the taxable year 
with respect to which such credits are determined.
(iv) Excluding the net elective payment amount determined under paragraph 
(e)(2)(iii) of this section, but including any applicable credits that are not part of the net 
elective payment amount, compute the allowed amount of GBC carryforwards carried to 
the taxable year plus the amount of current year GBCs allowed for the taxable year 
under section 38 (including, for clarity purposes, the ordering rules in section 38(d)). 
Apply these GBCs against the tax liability computed in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this 
section.
(v) Reduce the applicable credits for which an elective payment election is made 
by the net elective payment amount, as provided in paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section, 
and by the amount (if any) allowed as a GBC under section 38 for the taxable year, as 
provided in paragraph (e)(2)(iv) of this section, which results in the applicable credits 
being reduced to zero.
(3) Use of applicable credit for other purposes.  The full amount of the applicable 
credits for which an elective payment election is made is deemed to have been allowed 
for all other purposes of the Code, including, but not limited to, the basis reduction and 
recapture rules imposed by section 50 and calculation of tax, calculation of the amount 

of any underpayment of estimated tax under sections 6654 and 6655 of the Code, and 
the addition to tax for the failure to pay under section 6651(a)(2) of the Code (if any).
(4) Examples.  The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (e).
(i) Example 1.  U is a tax-exempt university that is not a trust subject to section 
469 and is described in section 501(c)(3).  U’s fiscal year runs from July 1 to June 30.  
U places in service P, energy property eligible for a section 48 credit, in June 2024.  P is 
an asset used in connection with its unrelated business.  U completes the pre-filing 
registration in accordance with §1.6417-5 as an applicable entity that has placed P into 
service and intends to make an elective payment election with respect to section 48 
credits determined with respect to P.  U timely files its 2024 Form 990-T on November 
15, 2024.  On its return, U properly determines that it has $500,000 of Unrelated 
Business Income Tax (UBIT) under section 512. On its Form 3800 attached to its return, 
U calculates its limitation of GBC under section 38(c) (simplified) is $375,000 
(paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section).  U attaches Form 3468 to claim a section 48 credit 
of $100,000 with respect to P (its GBC for the taxable year) (paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this 
section).  Under paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section, the net elective payment amount is 
$0, so the section 48 credit is considered a credit that reduces U’s UBIT liability to 
$400,000 under paragraph (e)(2)(iv) of this section.  U pays its $400,000 tax liability on 
November 15, 2024.   Under paragraph (e)(2)(v) of this section, the $100,000 of section 
48 credit is reduced by the $100,000 of applicable credits claimed as GBCs for the 
taxable year, which results in the applicable credits being reduced to zero.  However, 
the $100,000 of current year section 48 credit is deemed to have been allowed to U for 
2024 for all other purposes of the Code (paragraph (e)(3) of this section).
(ii) Example 2.  Assume the same facts as in paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section 
(Example 1), except that U has $80,000 of Unrelated Business Income Tax (UBIT) 
under section 512 and calculates its limitation of GBC under section 38(c) (simplified) is 
$60,000 (paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section).  Under paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section, 
the net elective payment amount is $40,000 (lesser of $100,000 applicable section 48 
credit or $100,000 of total GBC credits described in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section  
minus $60,000 of section 38(c) limitation). Under paragraph (e)(2)(iv) of this section, U 
uses $60,000 of its $100,000 of section 48 credit against its tax liability.  U reduces its 
applicable credit by the $40,000 net elective payment amount determined in paragraph 
(e)(2)(iii) of this section and by the $60,000 section 48 credit claimed against tax in 
paragraph (e)(2)(iv) of this section, resulting in the applicable credit being reduced to 
zero (paragraph (e)(2)(v) of this section).  When the IRS processes U’s 2024 Form 990-
T, the net elective payment amount results in a $20,000 refund to U (after applying 
$20,000 of the $40,000 net elective payment amount to cover U’s tax shown on the 
return).  However, for other purposes of the Code, the $100,000 section 48 credit is 
deemed to have been allowed to U for 2024 (paragraph (e)(3) of this section).
(iii) Example 3.  V is a city located in the United States that never has Federal 
income tax liability, so paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section does not apply.  V timely 
completes pre-filing registration in accordance with §1.6417-5 as an applicable entity 
that will be eligible to make an elective payment election, with regard to its annual 
accounting period ending in 2024, for the credit determined under section 30C(a) from 
properties A, B, and C; the credit determined under section 45(a) for facility D; the credit 
determined under section 45U(a) for facility E; the credit determined under section 
45W(a) with respect to vehicles F, G, and H; and the credit determined under section 

48(a) with respect to property I and J.  V timely files its 2024 Form 990-T.  V properly 
completes and attaches the relevant source credit forms and Form 3800 with 
registration numbers and all required information in the instructions, properly making the 
elective payment election for all of the credits, and properly determining that the amount 
of applicable credits determined with respect to A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, and J is 
$500,000 (its GBC for the taxable year) (paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section).  Under 
paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section, the net elective payment amount is $500,000.  
Under paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section, the entire $500,000 net elective payment 
amount is a payment against the tax imposed by subtitle A for the taxable year with 
respect to which such credits are determined.  When the IRS processes V’s 2024 Form 
990-T, the net elective payment amount results in a $500,000 refund to V.  V’s elective 
payment amount is reduced by the net elective payment amount, so all applicable 
credits for 2024 are reduced to zero (paragraph (e)(2)(v) of this section).  However, for 
other purposes of the Code, the $500,000 of applicable credits are deemed to have 
been allowed to V for its annual accounting period ending in 2024 (paragraph (e)(3) of 
this section).
(iv) Example 4.  W is a business taxpayer engaged in the manufacturing of 
components, including eligible components as defined in section 45X(c)(1) at facility F.  
W completes pre-filing registration in accordance with §1.6417-5 stating that it intends 
to elect to be treated as an applicable entity with respect to eligible components 
produced at F in 2024.  In 2025, W timely files its 2024 return electing to be treated as 
an applicable entity, calculating its Federal income tax before GBCs of $125,000 and 
that its limitation of GBC under section 38(c) (simplified) is $100,000 (paragraph (e)(2)(i) 
of this section).  W attaches Form 7207 to claim a current section 45X credit of $50,000 
with respect to eligible components produced at F (its applicable credits).  W also 
attaches Form 5884 to claim a current work opportunity tax credit (WOTC) of $50,000 
(WOTC is not an applicable credit).  W also has business credit carryforwards of 
$25,000, which together with the 45X credit and WOTC results in a total of $125,000 of 
GBC for the taxable year (paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section).  Under paragraph 
(e)(2)(iii) of this section, the net elective payment amount is $25,000.  Under paragraph 
(e)(2)(iv) of this section, including using the ordering rules in section 38(d), W is allowed 
$25,000 of the carryforwards, $50,000 of WOTC plus only $25,000 of section 45X credit 
against net income tax, as defined under section 38(c)(1)(B).  The $25,000 of unused 
section 45X credit is the net elective payment amount that results in a $25,000 payment 
against tax by W (paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section).  On its return, W shows net tax 
liability of $25,000 ($125,000 - $100,000 allowed GBC) and the net elective payment of 
$25,000 that W applied to net tax liability, resulting in zero tax owed on the return. 
Under paragraph (e)(2)(v) of this section, W’s applicable credit is reduced by the 
$25,000 of the net elective payment amount, as well as by the $25,000 of section 45X 
credit claimed as a GBC for the taxable year, resulting in the $50,000 of applicable 
credit being reduced to zero.  However, for all other purposes of the Code, the $50,000 
of 45X applicable credits are deemed to have been allowed to W for 2024 (paragraph 
(e)(3) of this section).  Even though W did not owe tax after applying the net elective 
payment amount against its net tax liability, W may be subject to the section 6655 
penalty for failure to pay estimated income tax.  The net elective payment is not an 
estimated tax installment, rather, it is treated as a payment made at the filing of the 
return.
(v) Example 5.  Assume the same facts as in paragraph (e)(4)(iv) of this section 
(Example 4), except W filed the return on a timely filed extension after the due date of 
the return (excluding extensions).  Even though the net elective payment amount is 

sufficient to cover W’s tax liability, W may also be subject to the section 6651(a)(2) 
penalty for failure to pay tax.
(vi) Example 6.  Assume the same facts as in paragraph (e)(4)(iv) of this section 
(Example 4), except W’s activities gave rise to a $100,000 section 45Q credit and W 
filed a Form 8933, Carbon Oxide Sequestration Tax Credit, instead of a $50,000 section 
45X credit and Form 7207.  Assume also that W’s activities gave rise to a $50,000 small 
employer health insurance credit under section 45R (section 45R credit) and W filed 
Form 8941, Credit for Small Employer Health Insurance Premiums, instead of a 
$50,000 WOTC and Form 5884.  Under paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section, the net 
elective payment amount is $75,000.  Under paragraph (e)(2)(iv) of this section, 
including using the ordering rules in section 38(d), W is allowed $25,000 of the 
carryforwards, $25,000 of the section 45Q credit, plus its $50,000 of section 45R credit 
against net income tax, as defined under section 38(c)(1)(B).  The $75,000 of unused 
section 45Q credit that is the net elective payment amount results in a $75,000 payment 
against tax by W (paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section).  On its return, W shows net tax 
liability of $25,000 ($125,000 - $100,000 allowed GBC) and the net elective payment 
amount of $75,000 that W applied to net tax liability, resulting in a refund of $50,000. 
Under paragraph (e)(2)(v) of this section, W’s applicable credit is reduced by the 
$75,000 of the net elective payment amount, as well as by the $25,000 of section 45Q 
credit claimed as a GBC for the taxable year, resulting in the $100,000 of applicable 
credit being reduced to zero.  However, for all other purposes of the Code, the $100,000 
of section 45Q applicable credits are deemed to have been allowed to W for 2024 
(paragraph (e)(3) of this section).
(f) Applicability date.  This section applies to taxable years ending on or after 
[INSERT DATE OF PUBLICATION IN THE FEDERAL REGISTER].  For taxable years 
ending before [INSERT DATE OF PUBLICATION IN THE FEDERAL REGISTER], 
taxpayers, however, may choose to apply the rules of §§1.6417-1 through 1.6417-4 and 
1.6417-6, provided the taxpayers apply the rules in their entirety and in a consistent 
manner.
§1.6417-3 Special rules for electing taxpayers.
(a) In general.  This section relates to the election available to electing taxpayers.  
An electing taxpayer that makes an elective payment election in accordance with this 
section is treated as an applicable entity for the duration of the election period, but only 
with respect to the applicable credit property described in proposed §1.6417-1(e)(3), (5), 
or (7), respectively, that is the subject of the election.  See paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) 
of this section for the specific rules regarding taxpayers making an election under 
section 6417(d)(1)(B), (C), or (D), respectively.  See paragraph (e) of this section for 

rules relating to the making the election.  See §1.6417-4 for special rules related to 
electing taxpayers that are partnerships or S corporations.
(b) Elections with respect to the credit for production of clean hydrogen.  An 
electing taxpayer that has placed in service applicable credit property described in 
§1.6417-1(e)(5) (in other words, a qualified clean hydrogen production facility as defined 
in section 45V(c)(3)) during the taxable year may make an elective payment election for 
such taxable year (or by August 16, 2023, in the case of facilities placed in service 
before December 31, 2022), but only with respect to the qualified clean hydrogen 
production facility, only with respect to the applicable credit described in §1.6417-1(d)(5) 
(in other words, the section 45V credit), and only if the pre-filing registration required by 
§1.6417-5 was properly completed.  An electing taxpayer that elects to treat qualified 
property that is part of a specified clean hydrogen production facility as energy property 
under section 48(a)(15) may not make an elective payment election with respect to such 
facility.
(c) Election with respect to the credit for carbon oxide sequestration.  An electing 
taxpayer that has, after December 31, 2022, placed in service applicable credit property 
described in §1.6417-1(e)(3) (in other words, a single process train described in 
§1.45Q-2(c)(3) at a qualified facility (as defined in section 45Q(d)) during the taxable 
year may make an elective payment election for such taxable year, but only with respect 
to the single process train, only with respect to the applicable credit described in 
§1.6417-1(d)(3) (in other words, the section 45Q credit), and only if the pre-filing 
registration required by §1.6417-5 was properly completed.
(d) Election with respect to the advanced manufacturing production credit.  An 
electing taxpayer that produces, after December 31, 2022, eligible components (as 
defined in section 45X(c)(1)) at an applicable credit property described in §1.6417-
1(e)(7) during the taxable year (whether the facility existed on or before, or after, 

December 31, 2022) may make an elective payment election for such taxable year, but 
only with respect to the facility at which the eligible components are produced by the 
electing taxpayer in that year, only with respect to the applicable credit described in 
§1.6417-1(d)(7) (in other words, the section 45X credit), and only if the pre-filing 
registration required by §1.6417-5 was properly completed.
(e) Election for electing taxpayers--(1) In general.  If an electing taxpayer makes 
an elective payment election under §1.6417-2(b) with respect to any taxable year in 
which the electing taxpayer places in service a qualified clean hydrogen production 
facility for which a section 45V credit is determined, places in service a single process 
train at a qualified facility for which a section 45Q credit is determined, or produces, 
after December 31, 2022, eligible components (as defined in section 45X(c)(1)) at a 
facility, respectively, the electing taxpayer will be treated as an applicable entity for 
purposes of making an elective payment election for such taxable year and during the 
election period described in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, but only with respect to the 
applicable credit property described in §1.6417-1(e)(3), (5), or (7), as applicable, that is 
the subject of the election.  The taxpayer must otherwise meet all requirements to earn 
the credit in the electing year and in each succeeding year during the election period 
described in paragraph (e)(3) of this section.
(2) Election is per applicable credit property.  An elective payment election under 
§1.6417-2(b) is made separately for each applicable credit property, which is, 
respectively, a qualified clean hydrogen production facility placed in service for which a 
section 45V credit is determined, a single process train placed in service at a qualified 
facility for which a section 45Q credit is determined, or a facility at which eligible 
components are produced for which a section 45X credit is determined.  An electing 
taxpayer may only make one election with respect to any specific applicable credit 
property.

(3) Election period--(i) In general.  Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of 
this section, if an electing taxpayer makes an elective payment election under §1.6417-
2(b) with respect to applicable credit property described in §1.6417-1(e)(3), (5), or (7) 
for which an applicable credit is determined under §1.6417-1(d)(3), (5), or (7), the 
election period during which such election applies includes the taxable year for which 
the election is made and each of the four subsequent taxable years that end before 
January 1, 2033.  The election period cannot be less than a taxable year but may be 
made for a taxable period of less than 12 months within the meaning of section 443 of 
the Code.
(ii) Revocation of election.  An electing taxpayer may, during a subsequent year 
of the election period described in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section, revoke the elective 
payment election with respect to an applicable credit property described in §1.6417-
1(e)(3), (5), or (7), in accordance with forms and instructions.  See §601.602 of this 
chapter.  Any such revocation, if made, applies to the taxable year for which the 
revocation is made (which cannot be less than a taxable year but may be made for a 
taxable period of less than 12 months as described in section 443 of the Code) and 
each subsequent taxable year within the election period.  Any such revocation may not 
be subsequently revoked.
(4) No transfer election under section 6418(a) permitted while an elective 
payment election is in effect.  No transfer election under section 6418(a) may be made 
by an electing taxpayer with respect to any applicable credit under §1.6417-1(d)(3), (5), 
or (7) determined with respect to applicable credit property described in §1.6417-
1(e)(3), (5), or (7) during the election period for that applicable credit property.  
However, if the election period is no longer in effect with respect to an applicable credit 
property, any credit determined with respect to such applicable credit property can be 
transferred pursuant to a transfer election under section 6418(a), as long as the 

taxpayer meets the requirements of section 6418 and the 6418 regulations.
(f) Applicability date.  This section applies to taxable years ending on or after 
[INSERT DATE OF PUBLICATION IN THE FEDERAL REGISTER].  For taxable years 
ending before [INSERT DATE OF PUBLICATION IN THE FEDERAL REGISTER], 
taxpayers, however, may choose to apply the rules of §§1.6417-1 through 1.6417-4 and 
1.6417-6, provided the taxpayers apply the rules in their entirety and in a consistent 
manner.
§1.6417-4 Elective payment election for electing taxpayers that are partnerships 
or S corporations.
(a) In general.  In the case of any applicable credit determined with respect to 
any applicable credit property described in §1.6417-1(e)(3), (5), or (7) that is held 
directly (or treated as held directly because it is held by a disregarded entity) by an 
electing taxpayer that is a partnership or S corporation, any elective payment election 
under §1.6417-2(b) must be made by the partnership or S corporation.
(b) Elections.  If an electing taxpayer that is a partnership or S corporation makes 
an elective payment election under §1.6417-2(b) with respect to any taxable year in 
which the electing taxpayer places in service applicable credit property described in 
§1.6417-1(e)(3) or (5), or produces, after December 31, 2022, eligible components (as 
defined in section 45X(c)(1)) at an applicable credit property described in §1.6417-
1(e)(7), the electing taxpayer will be treated as an applicable entity for purposes of 
making an elective payment election for such taxable year and during the election 
period described in §1.6417-3(e)(3), but only with respect to the applicable credit 
property described in §1.6417-1(e)(3), (5), or (7), respectively, that is the subject of the 
election.  In addition, the taxpayer must otherwise meet all requirements to earn the 
credit in the electing year and in each succeeding year during the election period 
described in §1.6417-3(e)(3).
(c) Effect of election--(1) In general.  If a partnership or S corporation electing 

taxpayer makes an elective payment election, with respect to the section 45V, 45Q, or 
45X credit--
(i) The Internal Revenue Service will make a payment to such partnership or 
S corporation equal to the amount of such credit, determined in accordance with 
paragraph (d) of this section (unless the partnership or S corporation owes a Federal 
tax liability, in which case the payment may be reduced by such tax liability);
(ii) Before determining any partner’s distributive share, or S corporation 
shareholder’s pro rata share, of such credit, such credit is reduced to zero and is, for 
any other purposes under the Code, deemed to have been allowed solely to such entity 
(and not allocated or otherwise allowed to its partners or shareholders) for such taxable 
year;
(iii) Any amount with respect to which such election is made is treated as tax 
exempt income for purposes of sections 705 and 1366 of the Code;
(iv) A partner’s distributive share of such tax exempt income is equal to such 
partner’s distributive share of the otherwise applicable credit for each taxable year, as 
determined under §1.704-1(b)(4)(ii);
(v) An S corporation shareholder’s pro rata share (as determined under section 
1377(a) of the Code) of such tax exempt income for each taxable year (as determined 
under sections 444 and 1378(b) of the Code) is equal to the S corporation shareholder’s 
pro rata share (as determined under section 1377(a)) of the otherwise applicable credit 
for each taxable year; and
(vi) Such tax exempt income resulting from such election is treated as received 
or accrued, including for purposes of sections 705 and 1366, as of the date the 
applicable credit is determined with respect to the partnership or S corporation. (such 
as, for investment credit property, the date the property is placed in service).
(2) Electing partnerships in tiered structures.  If a partnership (upper-tier 

partnership) is a direct or indirect partner of a partnership that makes an elective 
payment election (electing partnership) and directly or indirectly receives an allocation 
of tax exempt income resulting from the elective payment election made by the electing 
partnership, the upper-tier partnership must determine its partners’ distributive shares of 
such tax exempt income in proportion to the partners’ distributive shares of the 
otherwise applicable credit as provided in paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section.
(3) Character of tax exempt income.  Tax exempt income resulting from an 
elective payment election by an S corporation or a partnership is treated as arising from 
an investment activity and not from the conduct of a trade or business within the 
meaning of section 469(c)(1)(A) of the Code.  As such, the tax exempt income is not 
treated as passive income to any partners or shareholders who do not materially 
participate within the meaning of section 469(c)(1)(B).
(d) Determination of amount of the credit--(1) In general.  In determining the 
amount of an applicable credit that will result in a payment under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of 
this section, the partnership or S corporation must compute the amount of the 
applicable credit allowable as if an elective payment election were not made.  Because 
a partnership or S corporation is not subject to sections 38(b) and (c) and 469 (that is, 
those sections apply at the partner or S corporation shareholder level), the amount of 
applicable credit determined by a partnership or S corporation is not subject to limitation 
by those sections.  In addition, because the only applicable credits with respect to which 
a partnership or S corporation may make an elective payment election are not 
investment credits under section 46 of the Code, sections 49 and 50 of the code do not 
apply to limit the amount of the applicable credits.
(2) Example.  The rules of this paragraph (d) are illustrated in the following 
example.  A and B each contributed cash to P, a calendar-year partnership, for the 
purpose of manufacturing clean hydrogen at V, a qualified clean hydrogen facility that 
meets the definition of section 45V(c)(3).  The partnership agreement provides that A 
and B share equally in all items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit of P.  P 
completes the pre-filing registration process with respect to the section 45V credit at V 

for 2023 in accordance §1.6417-5.  P places V in service in 2023.  P timely files its 2023 
Form 1065 and properly makes the elective payment election in accordance with 
§§1.6417-2(b),1.6417-3, and 1.6417-4.  On its Form 1065, P properly determined that 
the amount of the section 45V credit with respect to the clean hydrogen produced at V 
for 2023 is $100,000.  The IRS processes P’s return and makes a $100,000 payment to 
P.  Before determining A’s and B’s distributive shares, P reduces the credit to zero.  
While the $100,000 section 45V credit is deemed to have been allowed to P for 2023 for 
any other purpose under this title, the credit is not allocated or otherwise allowed to its 
partners.  The $100,000 is treated as tax exempt income for purposes of section 705 
and is treated as arising from an investment activity and not from the conduct of a trade 
or business within the meaning of section 469(c)(1)(A).  P allocates the tax exempt 
income from the elective payment election proportionately among the partners based on 
each partner’s distributive share of the otherwise eligible section 45V credit as 
determined under §1.704-1(b)(4)(ii).  Under that section, if partnership receipts or 
expenditures give rise to a credit, the partner’s interest in the partnership with respect to 
such credit is in the same proportion as such partners’ distributive shares of such 
receipt, loss, or deduction.  Section 45V credits arise based on the amount of clean 
hydrogen produced at a facility.  Under the partnership agreement, A and B share all 
items equally.  Thus, A and B will each be allocated $50,000 of tax exempt income for 
2023.  P will continue to be treated as an applicable entity with respect to V for taxable 
years 2024-2027 unless P revokes its election in accordance with §1.6417-3(e)(3)(ii).  
At the end of 2023, A and B increase their respective tax bases in their partnership 
interest and capital accounts by $50,000 each (that is, their share of the $100,000 of tax 
exempt income).
(e) Partnerships subject to subchapter C of chapter 63.  For the application of 
subchapter C of chapter 63 of the Code to section 6417, see §301.6241-7 of this 
chapter.
(f) Applicability date.  This section applies to taxable years ending on or after 
[INSERT DATE OF PUBLICATION IN THE FEDERAL REGISTER].  For taxable years 
ending before [INSERT DATE OF PUBLICATION IN THE FEDERAL REGISTER], 
taxpayers, however, may choose to apply the rules of §§1.6417-1 through 1.6417-4 and 
1.6417-6, provided the taxpayers apply the rules in their entirety and in a consistent 
manner.
§1.6417-5 Additional information and registration.
(a) Pre-filing registration and election.  An applicable entity or electing taxpayer is 
required to satisfy the pre-filing registration requirements in paragraph (b) of this section 
as a condition of, and prior to, making an elective payment election.  An applicable 
entity or electing taxpayer must use the pre-filing registration process to register itself as 

intending to make the elective payment election, to list all applicable credits it intends to 
claim, and to list each applicable credit property that contributed to the determination of 
such credits as part of the pre-filing submission (or amended submission).  An 
applicable entity or electing taxpayer that does not obtain a registration number under 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section or report the registration number on its annual tax return, 
as defined in §1.6417-1(b), pursuant to paragraph (c)(5) of this section with respect to 
an otherwise applicable credit property, is ineligible to receive any elective payment 
amount with respect to the amount of any credit determined with respect to that 
applicable credit property.  However, completion of the pre-filing registration 
requirements and receipt of a registration number does not, by itself, mean the 
applicable entity or electing taxpayer is eligible to receive a payment with respect to the 
applicable credits determined with respect to the applicable credit property.
(b) Pre-filing registration requirements--(1) Manner of pre-filing registration.  
Unless otherwise provided in guidance, an applicable entity or electing taxpayer must 
complete the pre-filing registration process electronically through the IRS electronic 
portal and in accordance with the instructions provided therein.
(2) Pre-filing registration and election for members of a consolidated group.  A 
member of a consolidated group is required to complete pre-filing registration as a 
condition of, and prior to, making an elective payment election.  See §1.1502-77 
(providing rules regarding the status of the common parent as agent for its members).
(3) Timing of pre-filing registration.  An applicable entity or electing taxpayer must 
satisfy the pre-filing registration requirements of this paragraph (b) and receive a 
registration number under paragraph (c) of this section prior to making an elective 
payment election under §1.6417-2(b) on the applicable entity’s or electing taxpayer’s 
annual tax return for the taxable year at issue.  
(4) Each applicable credit property must have its own registration number.  An 

applicable entity or electing taxpayer must obtain a registration number for each 
applicable credit property with respect to which it intends to make an elective payment 
election.
(5) Information required to complete the pre-filing registration process.  Unless 
modified in future guidance, an applicable entity or electing taxpayer must provide the 
following information to the IRS to complete the pre-filing registration process:
(i) The applicable entity’s or electing taxpayer’s general information, including its 
name, address, taxpayer identification number, and type of legal entity.
(ii) Any additional information required by the IRS electronic portal, such as 
information regarding the taxpayer’s exempt status under section 501(a) of the Code; 
that the applicable entity is a political subdivision of a State, the District of Columbia, or 
a U.S. territory, or subdivision of an Indian tribal government; or that the applicable 
entity is an agency or instrumentality of a State, the District of Columbia, an Indian tribal 
government, or a U.S. territory.
(iii) The taxpayer’s taxable year.
(iv) The type of annual tax return(s) normally filed by the applicable entity or 
electing taxpayer, or that the applicable entity or electing taxpayer does not normally file 
an annual tax return with the IRS.
(v) The type of applicable credit(s) for which the applicable entity or electing 
taxpayer intends to make an elective payment election.
(vi) For each applicable credit, each applicable credit property that the applicable 
entity or electing taxpayer intends to use to determine the credit for which the applicable 
entity or electing taxpayer intends to make an elective payment election.
(vii) For each applicable credit property listed in paragraph (b)(4)(vi) of this 
section, any further information required by the IRS electronic portal, such as--
(A) The type of applicable credit property;

(B) Physical location (that is, address and coordinates (longitude and latitude) of 
the applicable credit property);
(C) Supporting documentation relating to the construction or acquisition of the 
applicable credit property (such as State, District of Columbia, Indian tribal, U.S. 
territorial, or local government permits to operate the applicable credit property; 
certifications; evidence of ownership that ties to a land deed, lease, or other 
documented right to use and access any land or facility upon which the applicable credit 
property is constructed or housed; U.S. Coast Guard registration numbers for offshore 
wind vessels; and the vehicle identification number of an eligible clean vehicle with 
respect to which a section 45W credit is determined);
(D) The beginning of construction date and the placed in service date of the 
applicable credit property,
(E) If an investment-related credit property (as defined §1.6417-2(c)(3)), the 
source of funds the taxpayer used to acquire the property; and
(F) Any other information that the applicable entity or electing taxpayer believes 
will help the IRS evaluate the registration request.
(viii) The name of a contact person for the applicable entity or electing taxpayer.  
The contact person is the person whom the IRS may contact if there is an issue with the 
registration.  The contact person must either possess legal authority to bind the 
applicable entity or electing taxpayer or must provide a properly executed power of 
attorney on Form 2848, Power of Attorney and Declaration of Representative.  
(ix) A penalties of perjury statement, effective for all information submitted as a 
complete application, and signed by a person with personal knowledge of the relevant 
facts that is authorized to bind the registrant.  
(x) Any other information the IRS deems necessary for purposes of preventing 
duplication, fraud, improper payments, or excessive payments under this section that is 

provided in guidance.
(c) Registration number--(1) In general.  The IRS will review the information 
provided and will issue a separate registration number for each applicable credit 
property for which the applicable entity or electing taxpayer provided sufficient verifiable 
information.
(2) Registration number is only valid for one taxable year.  A registration number 
is valid only with respect to the applicable entity or electing taxpayer that obtained the 
registration number under this section and only for the taxable year for which it is 
obtained.
(3) Renewing registration numbers.  If an elective payment election will be made 
with respect to an applicable credit property for a taxable year after a registration 
number under this section has been obtained, the applicable entity or electing taxpayer 
must renew the registration for that subsequent taxable year in accordance with 
applicable guidance, including attesting that all the facts previously provided are still 
correct or updating any facts.
(4) Amendment of previously submitted registration information if a change 
occurs before the registration number is used.  As provided in instructions to the pre-
filing registration portal, if specified changes occur with respect to one or more 
applicable credit properties for which a registration number has been previously 
obtained but not yet used, an applicable entity or electing taxpayer must amend the 
registration (or may need to submit a new registration) to reflect these new facts.  For 
example, if the owner of a facility previously registered for an elective payment election 
for applicable credits determined with respect to that facility and the facility undergoes a 
change of ownership (incident to a corporate reorganization or an asset sale) such that 
the new owner has a different employer identification number (EIN) than the owner who 
obtained the original registration, the original owner of the facility must amend the 

original registration to disassociate its EIN from the applicable credit property and the 
new owner must submit separately an original registration (or if the new owner 
previously registered other credit properties, must amend its original registration) to 
associate the new owner’s EIN with the previously registered applicable credit property.  
If the change of ownership is with respect to an electing taxpayer, then the 5-year 
election period will continue despite the change in ownership.
(5) Registration number is required to be reported on the return for the taxable 
year of the elective payment election.  The applicable entity or electing taxpayer must 
include the registration number of the applicable credit property on its annual tax return 
as provided in §1.6417-2(b) for the taxable year.  The IRS will treat an elective payment 
election as ineffective with respect to an applicable credit determined with respect to an 
applicable credit property for which the applicable entity or electing taxpayer does not 
include a valid registration number that was assigned to that particular taxpayer during 
the pre-registration process on the annual tax return.
(d) Applicability date.  This section applies to taxable years ending on or after 
[INSERT DATE OF PUBLICATION IN THE FEDERAL REGISTER].  
§1.6417-6 Special rules.
(a) Excessive payment--(1) In general.  In the case of any elective payment 
amount that the IRS determines constitutes an excessive payment, the tax imposed on 
such entity by chapter 1, regardless of whether such entity or taxpayer would otherwise 
be subject to chapter 1 tax, for the taxable year in which such determination is made will 
be increased by an amount equal to the sum of--
(i) The amount of such excessive payment, plus
(ii) An amount equal to 20 percent of such excessive payment.
(2) Reasonable cause.  The amount described in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this 
section will not apply to an applicable entity or electing taxpayer if the applicable entity 

or electing taxpayer demonstrates to the satisfaction of the IRS that the excessive 
payment resulted from reasonable cause.
(3) Excessive payment defined.  For purposes of this section, the term excessive 
payment means, with respect to an applicable credit property for which an elective 
payment election is made under §1.6417-2(b) for any taxable year, an amount equal to 
the excess of--
(i) The amount treated as a payment under §1.6417-2(a)(1)(i) or (a)(2)(i), or the 
amount of the payment made pursuant to §1.6417-2(a)(2)(ii), with respect to such 
applicable credit property for such taxable year, over
(ii) The amount of the credit that, without application of this section, would be 
otherwise allowable under the Code (as determined pursuant to §1.6417-2(c) and (e) or 
§1.6417-4(d)(1) and (3), and without regard to the limitation based on tax in section 
38(c)) with respect to such applicable credit property for such taxable year.  For 
purposes of this section, the amount of such credit that would be otherwise allowable is 
the amount claimed on an original or amended return, including any administrative 
adjustment request under section 6227.
(4) Example.  This example illustrates the principles of this paragraph (a).  B, an 
instrumentality of State M, places in service in 2023 facility F, which is eligible for the 
energy credit determined under section 48.  B properly completes the pre-filing 
registration as an applicable entity that will earn the energy credit from F in accordance 
with §1.6417-5, and receives a registration number for F.  B timely files its 2023 Form 
990-T, properly providing the registration number for F and otherwise complying with 
§1.6417-2(b).  On its Form 990-T, B calculates that the amount of energy credit 
determined with respect to F is $100,000 and that the net elective payment amount is 
$100,000.  B receives a refund in the amount of $100,000.  In 2025, the IRS determines 
that the amount of energy credit properly allowable to B in 2023 with respect to F (as 
determined pursuant to §1.6417-2(c) and (e) and without regard to the limitation based 
on tax in section 38(c)) was $60,000.  B is unable to show reasonable cause for the 
difference.  The excessive payment amount is $40,000 ($100,000 treated as a payment 
- $60,000 allowable amount).  In 2025, the tax imposed under chapter 1 on B is 
increased in the amount of $48,000 ($40,000 + (20% * $40,000).)
(b) Basis reduction and recapture--(1) In general.  Rules similar to the rules of 
section 50 (without regard to section 50(b)(3) and (4)(A)(i)) apply for purposes of this 

section.
(2) Reporting recapture.  Any reporting of recapture is made on the annual tax 
return of the applicable entity or electing taxpayer in the manner prescribed by the IRS 
in any guidance, along with supplemental forms such as Form 4255, Recapture of 
Investment Credit.
(3) Example.  This example illustrates the principles of this paragraph (b).  In 
December 2023, G, a government entity, places in service P, which is energy property 
eligible for the energy credit determined under section 48 (section 48 credit).  G properly 
completes the pre-filing registration in accordance with §1.6417-5 as an applicable 
entity to make an election under section 6417 for 2023.  G timely files its 2023 Form 
990-T in 2024, properly making the elective payment election in accordance with 
§1.6417-2 for a section 48 energy credit determined with respect to P.  On its Form 990-
T, G properly determines that the amount of section 48 credit determined with respect P 
is $100,000 and that its net elective payment amount is $100,000.  The IRS sends G a 
$100,000 refund.  Pursuant to section 50(c), G reduces its basis in P by $50,000.  In 
July 2025, P ceases to be investment credit property with respect to G.  Because this 
occurs before the close of the recapture period set forth in section 50, section 
50(a)(1)(A) provides that the tax under chapter 1 for 2025 is increased by the recapture 
percentage of the aggregate decrease in the credits allowed under section 38 for all 
prior taxable years that would have resulted solely from reducing to zero any credit 
determined under subpart E of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 with respect to such 
property.  Because P ceased to be investment credit property within 2 full years after P 
was placed in service, section 50(a)(1)(B) provides that the recapture percentage is 
80%.  G must properly report the recapture event in 2025, paying an $80,000 tax.  
Because G is a government entity, G reports the recapture event on a Form 990-T or 
any Form provided in further guidance, along with supplemental forms such as Form 
4255, Recapture of Investment Credit.  G’s basis in P is increased by $40,000.
(c) Mirror code territories.  Pursuant to section 6417(f) of the Code, section 6417 
and the section 6417 regulations are not treated as part of the income tax laws of the 
United States for purposes of determining the income tax law of any U.S. territory with a 
mirror code tax system (as defined in section 24(k) of the Code), unless such U.S. 
territory elects to have section 6417 and the section 6417 regulations be so treated.  
The applicable territory tax authority for a U.S. territory determines whether such an 
election has been made.
(d) Partnerships subject to subchapter C of chapter 63 of the Code.  See 
§301.6241-7(j) of this chapter for rules applicable to payments made to partnerships 
subject to subchapter C of chapter 63 of the Code for a partnership taxable year.

(e) Applicability date.  This section applies to taxable years ending on or after 
[INSERT DATE OF PUBLICATION IN THE FEDERAL REGISTER].  For taxable years 
ending before [INSERT DATE OF PUBLICATION IN THE FEDERAL REGISTER], 
taxpayers, however, may choose to apply the rules of §§1.6417-1 through 1.6417-4 and 
1.6417-6, provided the taxpayers apply the rules in their entirety and in a consistent 
manner.
